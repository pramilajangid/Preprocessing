# ASGN-1

Links to financial archives are given, and I have to extract some section's text from each of the text, to find out which kind of sentiment that section has.

The process is explained in the code itself. The challenging part was to accurately extract particular section from lot of unrelatable text. The fundamental tools like Regular Expression and NLTK was used to improve extraction process. Got to learn to deal with various kinds of textual subtleties in a manner that computational complexity is not that much. However, there wasn't any reference present to check the accuracy but, total positive and negative score had to be found.

Final code is present in the file named : 'final-play.ipynb'
