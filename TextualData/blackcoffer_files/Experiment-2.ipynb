Statements   (Unaudited)   1.             Basis of Presentation   On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix Incorporated subsidiary (\\x93InfoSpherix\\x94), subject to shareholder approval.  Accordingly, the operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the assets held for sale of the discontinued segment are separately identified in the Company\\x92s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The activities of the \\x93BioSpherix\\x94 Division continue to operate through Spherix Incorporated.   The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and do not include all of the information and disclosures generally required for annual financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the statements contain all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the Company\\x92s financial position as of June 30, 2007, the results of its operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, and its cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006.  This report should be read in conjunction with the Company\\x92s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which does contain the complete information and disclosure for the year ended December 31, 2006.   2.                            Use of Estimates and Assumptions   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.   3.                            Discontinued Operations   On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval.  The InfoSpherix segment comprises the majority of the Company\\x92s operations.  The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division\\x92s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.  The sale is subject to the approval of the Company\\x92s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company\\x92s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.   Facts and Circumstances Leading to the Proposed Sale   Spherix employed a business model for many years where it operated two separate lines of business \\x97 InfoSpherix and BioSpherix.  In accordance with the business plan, InfoSpherix earned enough money to support itself and BioSpherix.  This allowed InfoSpherix to grow while supplying funds for the research and development efforts of the BioSpherix Division, which focused on developing healthcare-related products.   By mid-2004, management believed that this model would soon have to change.  The product mix in InfoSpherix was shifting away from the commercial sector to a less profitable government sector.  Clients were beginning to require that the Company fund the upfront costs for information projects and recover the cost over the life of the project.  Also, our BioSpherix products were far enough along where continued development would soon require significant capital.  In addition, equity investors interested in BioSpherix did not understand InfoSpherix and its purpose.  Therefore, responsible investors were more difficult to attract.  Our InfoSpherix clients became concerned about our focus on this business and they questioned our long-term commitment to the business.  Also, our bank stated that it was not interested in funding biotechnology research.  Therefore, they required the Company to secure its line of credit with cash in lieu of receivables and other fixed assets.  Financing for capital equipment was becoming harder to attract.  As a result, at the February 17, 2005 meeting, the Board of Directors decided it was time to split the two divisions and require each one to be self-funding.  On June 8, 2005, the stockholders approved the establishment of InfoSpherix Incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spherix.  Subsequently, on January 1, 2006, InfoSpherix began operating as an independent subsidiary.   6         In December 2005, the FDA gave Spherix final permission to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial for Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  The Company signed agreements with independent contract research organizations to conduct the Phase 3 trial and engaged another entity to assist in the development and monitoring of the trials and to consult on FDA issues.  Although initial estimates developed by Spherix and the above consultants indicated we had sufficient capital to complete the trial, the Board and management became concerned about long-term financing.  A manufacturing source needed to be found and, should complications develop in our Phase 3 trial, final FDA approval of the protocol could result in significant additional capital needs.  In addition, it was becoming clear that InfoSpherix also needed capital to develop next generation products.   In the spring of 2006, Active Network approached the Company expressing an interest in the reservation portion of the InfoSpherix business and the Company held some preliminary discussion with the Active Network during the next few months.  On June 27, 2006, a meeting of the Executive Advisory Committee of the Board was held in Cumberland, Maryland.  The Committee discussed a potential sale of all or part of the InfoSpherix subsidiary, along with the use of funds from this sale and any settlement of our National Park Service dispute.  The Committee agreed that it was premature to make a decision as to whether any sale of InfoSpherix was desirable.  However, the Committee decided that if a sale was ever to be pursued, a sale of the entire subsidiary was preferential and that other potential buyers should be sought.   On November 17, 2006, the Company received a letter through its FDA consultant requiring additional expenditures on its Phase 3 clinical trial.  At this point it was becoming apparent that the Phase 3 trial was going to be more expensive than first thought.   Also on November 17, 2006, the Company received an unsolicited Letter of Intent (LOI) from Active Network.  The LOI was for the purchase of the entire information business.  The Board met on November 21, 2006.  After review of the LOI from The Active Network, the Board declined the offer.  Discussions were held on the need to raise more capital, even with the $6 million settlement related to the National Park Service.  The rising cost of the Phase 3 trial was discussed along with the need to complete the anti-plaque study of Naturlose at the University of Maryland.  Several methods of raising capital were discussed, but no final decision was made.   A special Board Meeting was held on January 8, 2007.  The immediate need to raise capital was discussed and the President was authorized to seek equity funding for $12-15 million to fund the BioSpherix Division.  In addition, further discussions were held to consider the possibility of selling InfoSpherix as a means of raising cash.   SC&H Capital Corporation (\\x93SC&H\\x94), a consulting firm with merger and acquisition experience, was engaged on January 29, 2007, to assist the management team in exploring a sale of InfoSpherix.  On March 6, 2007, the Board of Directors created an Evaluation Committee consisting of three outside directors appointed to provide SC&H with guidance in the process and to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest.   During the first several months of 2007, the President met with several investment bankers about the possibility of raising capital.  It was decided that, given the current stock price and early phase of the Phase 3 clinical trial, an equity offering would not be prudent at this time.   On April 13, 2007, a Board Meeting was held to review the capital raising alternatives.  In the course of reviewing these alternatives, SC&H reviewed the process it had conducted with management to that point.  Contact had been made with approximately 100 companies, including both strategic and financial targets, through the use of a blind profile which outlined the InfoSpherix opportunity.  This campaign ultimately resulted in approximately 10 management presentations provided to various interested parties.  The above activities yielded four Letters of Intent, including a revised offer from The Active Network.  One of the Letters of Intent was ultimately withdrawn.  SC&H prepared a comparison of each of the Letters of Intent and presented it to the Evaluation Committee.  A discussion of the possible terms and requirements of a deal ensued.   Pursuant to a recommendation from the Evaluation Committee, the Board concluded that a sale of InfoSpherix was in the best interests of Spherix and the Board approved a resolution to accept the offer from Active Network as proposed.  The Evaluation Committee was given the authority to approve any changes to the LOI consistent with the discussions.   7         Subsequent negotiations, led by the management team and outside counsel, were held with The Active Network and on April 17, 2007, a final LOI was signed.  Detailed due diligence has been conducted by Active Network and a definitive purchase agreement was executed on June 25, 2007.  The sale is subject to the approval of the Company\\x92s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company\\x92s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.

Net Income Per Share   Basic net income (loss) per common share has been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per common share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus common shares outstanding that are assumed likely to be exercised.  Diluted net loss per common share has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding without an assumed increase in common shares outstanding for common stock equivalents, as common stock equivalents are antidilutive.  Common stock equivalents consist of stock options and warrants that are assumed likely to be exercised.  Common stock equivalents were 55,470 and 66,886 at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   5.             Stockholders\\x92 Equity   During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company sold 442,358 shares for an additional $757,500 in proceeds under the July 22, 2005, Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (\\x93SEDA\\x94).  At June 30, 2007, the remaining maximum amount available for future draws under the SEDA was $800,000.   On March 9, 2006, in exchange for the Company\\x92s agreement to reduce the exercise price to $2.04 per share, an institutional investor (\\x93the Investor\\x94) agreed to exercise the remainder of its warrants for the purchase of 585,973 shares of common stock for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.  In connection with these warrants, the Investor agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to the extent that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that their holdings in the Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock.  The warrants and shares of Common Stock were issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.  The Company has registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by the institutional Investor.   6.             Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) \\x93Share-Based Payment\\x94 (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model and has elected to use the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, has not restated results for prior periods.  At the time the Company adopted FAS 123R, there were no unvested options outstanding. The Company realized stock based compensation expense of $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, related to 59,000 stock options awarded in February 2006.  The effect of adopting FAS 123R increased the loss from operations, the loss before taxes, and the net loss by $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, and had no effect on basic and diluted earnings per share, net cash flow from operations, or net cash flow from financing activities.   A summary of option activity under the Company\\x92s employee stock option plan for the six months ended June 30, 2007, is presented below:         Options               Shares               Weighted-    Average    Exercise    Price               Weighted-    Average    Remaining    Contractual    Term               Aggregate    Intrinsic    Value                   Outstanding at   December 31, 2006               501,100               $       7.11                                                   Granted               \\x97                                                                   Exercised               \\x97                                                                   Expired or forfeited               (122,000       )       $       6.26                                                   Outstanding at   June 30, 2007               379,100               $       7.38               2.5               $       8,000                                                                                                       Exercisable at   June 30, 2007               353,600                               2.5               $       5,000                                                                                                                                                                                             9         As of June 30, 2007, there were approximately 25,500 unvested options to purchase common stock under the plans.  An estimated compensation cost of $73,000 related to the unvested options is expected to be recognized over the next 2.6 years.   The Company used the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes calculation used to measure the fair value of stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R.           Expected term (in years)               4                   Expected   volatility               140.9       %           Expected   dividends               0       %           Risk-free rate               4.6       %               7.             Income Tax   The Company adopted Financial Standards Accounting Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (\\x93FIN 48\\x94) on January 1, 2007.  As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no material adjustments.  The Company\\x92s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on tax liabilities as interest expense.  At January 1, 2007 and June 30, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized income tax benefits and recognized no interest or penalties on income tax liabilities.   The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations have not expired for the Company\\x92s tax years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2005.  As such, each of these tax years remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.  The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations for the Company\\x92s tax years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2002 have expired; however $10,217,000 of Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in these closed years remain available to the Company and are subject to adjustment prior to utilization in future tax years.   8.             Information by Business Segment   The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.  BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications.  InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.  Revenue from reservation and tourism services is greatest in the spring and summer when vacation planning is the heaviest.  Revenue from other sources tends to be more evenly spread throughout the year, although the fourth quarter is historically the low period of the year.   Financial information by business segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 is summarized below.   10                                                   Three Months Ended    June 30,    (Dollars in thousands)               Six Months Ended    June 30,    (Dollars in thousands)                                                   2007               2006               2007               2006                   Revenue               InfoSpherix               $       6,490               $       7,582               $       11,837               $       13,501                                   BioSpherix               4               \\x97               4               3                                   Total   revenue               $       6,494               $       7,582               $       11,841               $       13,504                                                                                                                       Operating   (Loss) Income               InfoSpherix               $       362               $       987               $       60               $       1,124                   and (Loss) Income Before               BioSpherix               (2,114       )       (751       )       (4,191       )       (1,421       )           Income Taxes               Total   operating loss               (1,752       )       236               (4,131       )       (297       )                           Interest income               80               53               190               88                                   Interest expense               8               30               18               65                                                                                                                                       Income (loss) from   operations before income taxes               $       (1,680       )       $       259               $       (3,959       )       $       (274       )                                                   June 30,               Dec. 31,                                                                                                           2007               2006                                                   Identifiable   Assets               InfoSpherix               $       14,765               $       13,896                                                                   BioSpherix               1,428               4,480                                                                   Total   assets               $       16,193               $       18,376                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             9.             Subsequent Event   In August 2007, InfoSpherix signed a ten-year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of facility space in Clarksburg, Maryland, for use as an administrative office for InfoSpherix.  The target commencement date for the new lease is November 1, 2007.  In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility.  Under the lease termination agreement, Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease.   On June 25, 2007, as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America (\\x93the Bank\\x94) prior to closing.  Accordingly, the Company has subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank.  The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was established on March 31, 2006.  The line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary\\x92s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.  The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and at the time of termination.   Item 2.  Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   The following is intended to update the information contained in the Company\\x92s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and presumes that readers have access to, and will have read, \\x93Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\x94 contained in such Form 10-K.   Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as \\x93believes,\\x94 \\x93expects,\\x94 is or are \\x93expected,\\x94 \\x93anticipates,\\x94 \\x93anticipated,\\x94 \\x93should\\x94 and words of similar impact.  These forward-looking statements are based on the Company\\x92s current expectations.  Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company\\x92s actual results could differ materially.  See the Company\\x92s Form 8-K filing dated March 26, 1999, for a more detailed statement concerning forward-looking statements.   Overview   The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.  BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications.  InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.   11         BioSpherix engages in product development, notably tagatose.  The Company\\x92s current focus is on the non-food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name \\x93Naturlose\\x94.  Our principal efforts have been to explore whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  In April 2007, the Company commenced a Phase 3 trial for this purpose.   InfoSpherix has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its ReserveWorld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the U.S.  Reservation contracts make up over 50% of the Company\\x92s revenue.  The reservation services contracts have revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months when vacation planning is more prevalent.  These reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue throughout the year such as depreciation, telephone and computer related service and maintenance contracts, and minimum staffing requirements.  These contracts also incur certain costs in advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that will be needed during the peak seasons.  On January 23, 2007, the Company concluded its long-standing National Park Service contract.  The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.   On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval.  The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division\\x92s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.  The sale is subject to the approval of the Company\\x92s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the Company\\x92s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.   The operations of InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations.   Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 and 2006   Selling, General and Administrative   Selling, general and administrative expenses (S,G&A) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, increased $386,000 and $494,000 over those of the same periods in 2006.  The increase in the second quarter was primarily the result of an executive bonus of $150,000 awarded to the CEO for past performance, and an increase in accounting costs of approximately $120,000 related to the increased complexity of the Company\\x92s tax reporting requirements including the implementation of FIN 48.  The increase in S,G&A costs for the six months ended June 30, 2007 over those of the prior year also included approximately $120,000 in costs related to the services of an investment banker prior to the Company\\x92s decision to sell InfoSpherix.  Excluded from the above S,G&A numbers is approximately $170,000 in consulting and legal costs related to the sale of InfoSpherix that have been classified as part of the costs of the discontinued operations.  These costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2007, following the decision to sell InfoSpherix.   Research and Development   The Company\\x92s R&D expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of the Company\\x92s Phase 3 clinical trial in the use of Naturlose for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, which began this year.  The primary focus of BioSpherix\\x92s research and development (R&D) activities for the six months ended June 30, 2007, has been on the planning and preparation of a Phase 3 trial.  The Company has completed an initial dose range-finding study, and the recruitment of patients for the trial, which will take place in Australia and the United States, is ongoing.  The first participants began the Phase 3 clinical trial in April 2007.  More than 400 subjects from the United States and abroad, representing the demographic mix in the U.S., will receive oral doses of Naturlose to test its ability to treat Type 2 diabetes.  A Phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the FDA.  The Company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product, lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates.  Testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009.  If the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application (\\x93NDA\\x94) to the FDA.  The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA.  Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-2010 at the earliest.   12         In 2005, the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.  The study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  The study suggested ways of modifying the Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction.  Such modifications have been made, and the Company has arranged with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt to establish an anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis claim for the toothpaste.  The clinical trial started in early 2007.   InfoSpherix                         Three Months Ended June 30,               Six Months Ended June 30,                                   2007               2006               2007               2006                   Revenue               $       6,490,000               $       7,582,000               $       11,837,000               $       13,501,000                   Direct cost and   operating expense               5,471,000               5,684,000               10,387,000               10,602,000                   Gross margin               $       1,019,000               $       1,898,000               $       1,450,000               $       2,899,000                       Revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, decreased $1.1 million (14%) and $1.7 million (12%) from the same periods in 2006 due to the completion of the National Park Service contract, which concluded on January 23, 2007.  Reductions from the direct costs associated with the National Park Service Contract were off-set by increased costs under the new Michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the former South Dakota facility to the new facility in Indiana.  The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.   Liquidity and Capital Resources, Consolidated   On June 25, 2007, as part of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America (\\x93the Bank\\x94) prior to closing.  Accordingly, the Company subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank.  The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was established on March 31, 2006.  The line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary\\x92s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.  The interest rate under the Agreement was based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.5% at June 30, 2007).  The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and the total amount available for future advances to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under the Agreement.   Working capital as of June 30, 2007, was $7.8 million, which represents a $3.1 million decrease from working capital of $10.9 million at December 31, 2006.  The decrease in working capital was largely related to the Company\\x92s Phase 3 clinical trial costs and increased costs related to the anticipated sale of InfoSpherix.   Spherix expects to expend up to $5 million over the next year in costs related to the Phase 3 clinical trial and other R&D activity.  The clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete.  The Company intends to finance the BioSpherix activities through proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary and proceeds from possible future issuance of additional common stock.  The Company also intends to seek pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the BioSpherix products.   Cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2007, reflects a net cash outflow of $2.8 million, consisting of $2.4 million used in operating activities, $1.2 million used in investing activities, and $768,000 provided by financing activities.  The increase in cash used by operating activities in 2007 from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost of the Phase 3 clinical trial.  The change in cash used in investing activities is related to one-time proceeds of $2 million from the maturity of a certificate of deposit in the prior year.  Cash flows from financing activities in 2006 included proceeds from the issuance of warrants.   13           Trends and Outlooks   BioSpherix   ·                    On June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period).  The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division\\x92s biotechnology products.   ·                    BioSpherix\\x92s primary emphasis is on a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose is a successful treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  The trial began in April 2007, and testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009.  If the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application (\\x93NDA\\x94) to the FDA.  The FDA will then likely take up to a year to respond to the NDA.  Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-to-late 2010 at the earliest.   ·                    The Company has decided to conduct the entire Phase 3 clinical trial for Type 2 diabetes in the United States and according has terminating the Australian trials. The change is intended to simplify the logistics of managing the trial.   ·                    Costs of conducting the Phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed in the trial.  The Company expects to spend up to $5 million in R&D costs over the next year.  The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary to fund the Phase 3 trial.  If the sale is not concluded, the Company will need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs of the tests and the expected follow-on costs in pursuit of FDA approval.   ·                    A human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose was conducted by the Company at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry.  The trial started in early 2007 and was completed in July.  The Company expects to receive the results later this year.   ·                    Spherix has subsequently launched a health sciences consulting business line to provide technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.   InfoSpherix   ·                    As noted above, on June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period).   ·                    The Company concluded the National Park Service contract on January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.  The loss of the National Park Service contract will have an adverse effect on the Company\\x92s financial results in comparison to the prior year.   ·                    Since 1998, InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to 17 government reservation contracts.  InfoSpherix\\x92s reservation business accounted for over 60% of the Company\\x92s revenue in 2006 and 2005, and over 50% for the three months ended March 31, 2007.  InfoSpherix is now one of only two major suppliers of Government campground reservation services in the U.S.   ·                    On February 6, 2007, InfoSpherix signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet of facility space in Frostburg, Maryland effective December 1, 2007, for use as a call center to replace the existing Cumberland, Maryland facility.   ·                    In August 2007, InfoSpherix signed a ten-year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of facility space in Clarksburg, Maryland, for use as an administrative office for InfoSpherix.  The target commencement date for the new lease is November 1, 2007.  In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility.  Under the lease termination agreement, Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease.   ·                    The Company will cease to have any continuing obligations under the Frostburg, Maryland, or Clarksburg, Maryland, leases upon completion of the sale of InfoSpherix.  The Company will relocate to a smaller facility upon termination of the Beltsville lease.   14         Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   The Company manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies.   At June 30, 2007, the Company did not have any fixed-rate or variable-rate indebtedness.  The Company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness.   Cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds, which generally mature in 30 days, or money-market funds.  In general, such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.  The carrying amounts approximate market value.  It is the Company\\x92s practice to hold these investments to maturity.   Assuming the June 30, 2007, variable rate debt and cash and cash available for investment, a one-percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than $100,000.   Item 4.  Controls and Procedures   Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\\x92s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of \\x93disclosure controls and procedures\\x94 in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.   Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.   Management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management\\x92s override of the control.  The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.   Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion.    The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\\x92s management, including the Company\\x92s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\\x92s disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\\x92s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.  There were no significant changes in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.   15         Part II.  Other Information   Item 1a.  Risk Factors   In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, \\x93Item 1A Risk Factors\\x94 in our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2006, and those included in the Company\\x92s Proxy Statement for the August 15, 2007 annual meeting, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  The risks described in our Form 10-K and Proxy Statement are not the only risks facing our Company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

incorporated the company or registrant a delaware corporation was founded in . the company consists of a biotechnology segment biospherix and an information services segment infospherix. at the may annual meeting shareholders approved the establishment of infospherix as a whollyowned subsidiary of spherix which took effect january . the principal executive offices of the company are located at indian creek court beltsville maryland and its telephone number is . the companys common stock trades on the nasdaq global market system under the symbol spex. available information our principal internet address is www.spherix.com . we make available free of charge on www.spherix.com our annual quarterly and current reports and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission sec. biospherix this division is the companys biotechnology research and development arm dedicated to developing proprietary products with a view toward commercial applications. the company has accumulated a number of patents on the products and processes developed by biospherix. as set forth below these products are in the development stage and will require substantial additional investment to bring any of these products to market. tagatose as a lowcalorie fullbulk sweetener. spherix has patented the use of a naturally occurring sugar tagatose as a lowcalorie fullbulk sweetener. it is a true sugar that looks feels and tastes like table sugar. the company has developed and patented a method for making tagatose from whey or lactose. whey is a waste product from cheese manufacturing. seq.foliofilecfcdca.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay the firm has been developing its sweetener since receiving a u.s. patent for its use and manufacture as a lowcalorie sweetener in which patent expired august . the company received two u.s. patents for its tagatose production process in and which both expire july . it has received a number of foreign patents corresponding to these three and other u.s. patents. these countries include canada and japan both large potential markets. in january the company completed a license agreement with arla foods ingredients amba arla formerly md foods ingredients amba mdfi of denmark for the exclusive worldwide rights to market and distribute tagatose as a food and beverage ingredient in return for a nonrefundable upfront payment and fees on net sales of the sugar for these purposes. arla manufactures a wide variety of dairy products foods and food ingredients it ranks as one of the largest dairy products manufacturers in the world. arla operates cheese plants producing large amounts of whey as a byproduct. the license agreement and an amendment thereto provide arla the worldwide right to manufacture and sell tagatose for food uses and the right to manufacture tagatose for all uses. a panel of experts retained by arla declared tagatose as generally recognized as safe gras on april permitting sale of tagatose as a food ingredient in the u.s. the u.s. food and drug administration fda issued a no objection letter on october . tagatose was recommended by the joint faowho expert committee on food additives jecfa panel in june to its many member countries for use in foods and in june jecfa removed its former limit on daily consumption of tagatose. in approval was obtained in south korea. in april tagatose was approved by the food standards australia new zealand fsanz the food health and safety agency for australia and new zealand. in december tagatose was approved in the european union. arla has begun the approval process for tagatose in canada japan and mexico. the u.s. fda approved arlas recommended caloric value of . kilocalories per gram permitting labeling of products containing it as reduced calorie in the u.s. in arla formed a joint venture with nordzucker a german sugar producer for the manufacture and sale of tagatose. the joint venture factory was capable of producing metric tons per year. at present arla believes it has produced a sufficient backlog of inventory to satisfy its needs for the foreseeable future based on current demand and accordingly has stopped production at its pilot plant until there is a sufficient increase in the demand for tagatose. to date spherix has earned minimal royalties from arla and given the cessation of production by arla spherix does not currently expect to receive any future royalties. with spherixs efforts focusing on the nonfood potentials of naturlose the company is pursing the possibility of recovering its technology from arla or securing other production options. spherix retains the rights to the nonfood uses to tagatose. the company has discovered and patented a number of health and medical uses for its product which it has branded naturlose for uses in health and medicine as outlined below. a priority among these patented uses is the use of naturlose in treating type diabetes. treatment for type diabetes. trials at the university of maryland school of medicine have found tagatose effective as a treatment of type diabetes in humans. in addition to alleviating symptoms of this major disease over the oneyear trial all subjects lost weight at physicianapproved rates and showed a significant increase in the desirable type of cholesterol hdl. other than for initial laxation at high doses to grams per capita per day accommodated in about two weeks no untoward effects were found in any of the research. in addition the studies found that naturlose produced no rise in blood glucose or insulin levels in diabetic or normal subjects. naturlose taken before the consumption of glucose produced a blunting effect on the otherwise normally expected rise in blood glucose. in late the fda gave biospherix permission to begin a phase clinical trial for naturlose as a standalone drug to treat diabetes. since then biospherixs research and development rd activity has been focused primarily on planning and instituting the phase trial. the phase clinical trial is the last major test if successful before requesting drug approval. the company has negotiated two agreements with contract research organizations cro to conduct the trial and has retained environ international an fda regulatory consultant to guide the trial. the company has completed the dose rangefinding study and will now proceed with recruiting patients for the trial which will take place in australia and the united states. the first participants are expected to begin the phase clinical trial in april . more than subjects from the united states and abroad representing the demographic mix in the u.s. will receive oral doses of naturlose to test its ability to treat type diabetes. a phase clinical trial which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety is needed to evaluate the overall benefitrisk relationship of new drugs proposed to the fda. the company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates. seq.foliofilecfcdca.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay antiplaque agent in the company contracted with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct human clinical trials on the oral antiplaque efficacy of naturlose. the study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria which form plaque than is sorbitol a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products. the study suggested ways of modifying the naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction. such modifications have been made and the company has arranged with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct a trial of naturlose toothpaste formulated by the company in an attempt to establish an antiplaque claim for the toothpaste. the clinical trial started in early . antihyperglycemic agent. tagatose functions as an antihyperglycemic agent to prevent the formation of advanced glycosylation endproducts which is one of the major causes of aging. increasing the shelf life of stored blood platelets and medicinal proteins. the outsourced project seeking to establish the use of naturlose to extend the shelflife of blood fractions and various other medical products has been suspended as biospherix concentrates on the type diabetes trial. anemia and hemophilia treatment . naturlose has been shown to improve blood factors indicating that tagatose may be useful as a drug or drug adjuvant in the treatment of anemia and hemophilia. increased fertility and improved fetal development drug. naturlose may increase the fertility of humans and other animals to effect higher percentages of live fetuses and to cause those fetuses to be heavier but within normal bounds than those of human or animal controls. preservative of human organs. naturlose has shown potential for use in the transplanting and storage of human organs to protect against cytooxidation and toxic chemicals. prototypes of naturlosebased mouthwash cough syrup and a fiber digestive aid have been developed by biospherix. other projects are in the conceptual stage. all of the potential uses mentioned above require further clinical trial studies and regulatory approval before they can be brought to market. capital for development . while the products under development show promise continued progress is dependent upon many factors including but not limited to the companys having sufficient funds and resources to pursue them. over its history the company has supported its research and development in part by using funds generated by infospherix however due to the capital needs of infospherix and bank covenants restrictions infospherix may not be able to support the activities of biospherix. funds have also been raised from private placements of company stock and warrants some of the proceeds of which have been used to increase the state of development market penetration and sales of the products mentioned above. the company believes that it will require substantial amounts of additional capital to develop and bring its biospherix products to market. in order to fully develop manufacture distribute and sell naturlose for these purposes the company is seeking to raise funds and will also seek a relationship with a major pharmaceutical company. biospherix revenue accounted for less than of the companys total revenue in . infospherix incorporated in january the infospherix business started operating as a whollyowned subsidiary of spherix incorporated under the name infospherix incorporated. infospherix professionals design and operate contact centers websites and field kiosks providing information management and materials to the public on various socially beneficial subjects as well as other information services such as reservations and tourism. infospherix focuses on those clients who are looking to leverage technology in the everadvancing world of information management. infospherix researches collects organizes and disseminates information by providing customized contact center services combining advanced data collection systems expert decision support systems telesupport utilizing live operators and advanced telecommunication technologies such as seq.foliofilecfcdca.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay interactive voice response ivr. infospherix answers millions of calls annually from professionals and the public nationwide. it operates a contact center in cumberland maryland and a second contact center in carmel indiana. during the operations of the rapid city south dakota contact center were relocated to carmel indiana. all contact centers efficiently manage and track high volumes of data. coupling infospherixs expert staff with its advanced technologies results in an effective system to collect and disseminate large amounts of information. the company also provides reservation services for campgrounds and other parks via its reserveworld business line. since infospherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to seventeen park reservation contracts. infospherix is one of only two major companies in this market. in spherix won a new park reservation contract won the recompete on two park reservation contracts and will be the subcontractor on another. infospherixs reservation business accounted for of the companys revenue in . in october the company agreed to a million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the u.s. department of agriculture over the governments award of a national park and reservation contract to reserveamerica. the company operated the national park service contract for nine years revenue recognized was . million . million and . million for the years ended december and respectively or and of total revenue for each year. the companys national park service contract ended january . infospherix accounted for substantially all of the companys revenue in . most of infospherixs revenue traditionally has been generated by a few large government contracts. see note concentrations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to part ii of this form k. government contracts see note commitment and contingencies government contracts of the notes to the financial statements included herein pursuant to part ii item of this form k which information is incorporated herein by reference. government contracts typically have terms and conditions which while providing annual or multiyear terms subject them to termination upon convenience or default. industry segments see note information by business segment of the notes to the financial statements included herein pursuant to part ii item of this form k for industry segment information of the company which information is incorporated herein by reference. market concentration during and essentially all of the companys revenue was generated by infospherix. the companys business operations are usually dependent upon substantial revenue from a select group of customers. in and revenue from the u.s. government the state of michigan and the state of maryland each accounted for more than of total company revenue. it is currently expected that revenue from the u.s. government the state of michigan the state of maryland and the state of ohio will each account for more than of total company revenue in . seq.foliofilecfcdca.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay patents and trademarks the company has established a strong worldwide patent position for tagatose. these patents and other significant company patents are detailed in the following table patent no. patent title issue date expiration date u.s. dtagatose as an antibiofilm agent u.s. method for preventing or minimizing biodegradation of a

naturlose for nonfood uses of tagatose and biospherix. it retains trademarks on its original name biospherics and a former subsidiary vitalian corp. with respect to all of its inventions the company has received approximately patents including foreign issues. it has several patents pending and many additional invention disclosures. in addition to its strong patent position the company relies on the common law protection of such information as trade secrets and on confidentiality agreements to protect the value of these assets. seasonality revenue from reservation and tourism services is greatest in the spring and summer when vacation planning is the heaviest. revenue from other sources tends to be more evenly spread throughout the year although the fourth quarter is historically the low period of the year. sales backlog sales backlog consisting of both funded and unfunded amounts at december and were as follows in s december december current non current total current non current total infospherix government infospherix commercial as previously noted the company agreed to a million settlement of its longstanding legal dispute over the award of the nrrs contract to reserveamerica. as a result the companys national park service contract ended january . despite the loss of the national park service contract the company has developed a successful seq.foliofilecfcdcc.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay niche in providing government campground reservation services growing from one to reservation contracts over the past nine years and won the recompete on two of its state reservation contracts. the company will continue to pursue its expansion into the state campground reservation niche. competition infospherix the information systems industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change. the company is in competition with other information services companies across the nation. many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources than the company. while acknowledging strong competition from other information services firms the company has developed a specialized niche by concentrating on high quality personalized service combined with computerization for efficiency and costeffectiveness. the company has established a reputation for rapidly starting up information projects to meet its clients critical needs while not compromising high quality and reasonable pricing. the company has also established a successful niche in government campground reservation services and is now one of only two major suppliers of campground services in the u.s. the other major supplier is iacinteractivecorps reserveamerica a subsidiary of ticketmaster. over the last three years the company has invested over million in computer and telephony systems and nearly million in the development of specialized computer software products to improve its competitive position. the company continues to upgrade and enhance those systems. biospherix competitors of biospherix are numerous and include among others major pharmaceutical chemical consumer and biotechnology companies specialized firms universities and other research institutions. the companys competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that are being developed by the company and that could render the companys technology and potential products obsolete and noncompetitive. many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the company. research and development biospherix expenditures for research and development were approximately and in and respectively. these expenditures were incurred primarily in the ongoing efforts to commercialize naturlose including its development for drug uses and improved production processes. governmental regulation the business activities of the company are subject to a variety of federal and state compliance licensing and certification requirements. management believes that the company is and has been at all times in full compliance with federal and state environmental protection and worker safety laws. the company is also required to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of . on september the sec announced the extension of the compliance dates of section of the sarbanesoxley act for nonaccelerated filers. under the extension nonaccelerated filers such as spherix will begin to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements for the first fiscal year ending on or after december . the company anticipates that the cost of implementing section over the next two years could have a material impact on the results of operations. environment compliance with current federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had and in the opinion of management will not have a material effect on the companys financial position results of operations capital expenditures cash flows or competitive position. seq.foliofilecfcdcc.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay employees in the company employed an average of individuals on a full or parttime basis. of this total approximately were fulltime employees. the companys employees are not currently unionized and management believes that its relation with the companys employees are harmonious. geographic areas infospherixs business is and has been based in the united states. accordingly infospherix revenue is entirely from u.s.based operations. item a. risk factors any of the risk factors we describe below could severely harm our business financial condition and operating results. the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events. risks related to our business we continue to be dependent on our information services division for all of our revenue . in each of and our information services segment accounted for nearly of our revenue. despite licensing tagatose in for food and beverage use our principal biotechnology product we have yet to receive any substantial royalties from the sales of tagatose by our licensee. we are actively pursuing various nonfood uses of naturlose including as a treatment for type diabetes. thus we have incurred substantial and continuing losses in our biotechnology segment which have adversely affected our overall financial results. if we continue to be unsuccessful in commercializing our biotechnology products our financial results will continue to be adversely affected to the detriment of our stock price. our largest information services contract was awarded to a competitor. in october the company agreed to a million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the u.s. department of agriculture over the governments award of the national recreation reservation service nrrs contract to reserveamerica a ticketmaster subsidiary. the companys national park service contract ended january . the national park service contract contributed . million in revenue for each of the years ended december and . we will need to replace it with other work to avoid an adverse impact on our financial results. our information services business could be adversely affected by significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the u.s. federal government. we derive substantial revenue from contracts with the u.s. federal government and we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in u.s. federal government contract programs. accordingly changes in u.s. federal government contracting policies could directly affect our financial performance. among the factors that could have a material adverse affect on our u.s. federal government contracting business are budgetary constraints affecting u.s. federal government spending generally or specific departments or agencies in particular and changes in fiscal policies or available funding technological developments u.s. federal governmental shutdowns and other potential delays in the government appropriations process delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices due to problems with or upgrades to government information systems or for other reasons competition and consolidation in the information services industry and general economic conditions. our information services business is reliant on technology. we have devoted significant resources to developing and acquiring specialized hardware and software in our information services business. in order to remain competitive we must continue to select invest in acquire and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis. we may not be successful in these efforts or in anticipating developments in technology. in addition competitors could develop similar applications. third parties could independently develop similar technology obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary technology or misappropriate technology to which we have granted access. failure to remain current with technology or misappropriation of our technology could adversely affect our ability to compete for information services business and could lead to reduced business and reduced financial results. seq.foliofilecfcdcc.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay we have not yet successfully commercialized naturlose. we are in the process of attempting to develop other uses of tagatose under the brand name naturlose in nonfood products such as a treatment for diabetes toothpaste mouthwash and overthecounter and pharmaceutical drugs. efforts are presently limited to the type diabetes clinical trial and toothpaste developments because of cash limitations. to date we have yet to secure any substantial revenue from naturlose sales. one of the hurdles we will have to overcome is that our foreign licensee for tagatose which has the right to manufacture tagatose does not currently have sufficient capacity to manufacture enough tagatose to supply both food and nonfood markets if such markets mature and grow. failure to successfully commercialize naturlose may adversely affect our stock price. other biotech products are still in the development stage. we are developing other biotech products. none of these have been developed to a stage where any significant revenue has been generated. development of products will require significant additional research and development. such additional effort will require substantial funding which may not be available to us. further our research and development activities may not result in any saleable products. it is also possible that we will license or seek an affiliation with a third party to bring some products to market. in such an event we would likely have minimal control over the manufacture and marketing of such products. development of any biotech products will depend on obtaining fda and foreign regulatory approvals. development of new products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries. these rigorous regulatory approval processes can take five to ten years or more and require the expenditure of substantial resources. we may not be able to obtain the necessary approvals for clinical testing or for the marketing of products. continuing failure to commercialize biotechnology products may adversely affect our financial results and stock price. our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products. we have several patents for tagatose and other products under development. we may not be able to obtain additional patents. further future patents may not be held valid if

affect our financial results and stock price. we have sustained losses in the past and we may sustain losses in the future. we have incurred losses in prior years including the years and . our net losses for the years ended december and were . million and . million respectively. our net income for the year ended december included million from the u.s. department of agriculture settlement. we may not return to profitable operations. we may not be able to obtain additional financing that we will need. during our working capital increased by . million largely as a result of proceeds from the u.s. department of agriculture settlement and proceeds from stock issuances. in recent years we have funded our operations through private placements of our common stock and through the exercise of warrants issued in connection with such private placement transactions. we believe that we will need to raise additional funding to continue to finance our product development operations. we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. failure to obtain required financing may cause us to curtail or cease our operations. we may not be able to retain our key executives and personnel. as a small company our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and other positions. none of our key employees have employment agreements. the loss of the services of one or more of such employees could have a material adverse effect on us. we face intense competition by competitors in both divisions. our competitors in the information services business are numerous. many of our competitors have significantly greater financial marketing and distribution resources than we do. our principal information services competitor reserveamerica is a division of ticketmaster which is a subsidiary of iacinteractive corp. a significantly larger public company than spherix. our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and biotechnology products that are more effective than ours. seq.foliofilecfcdcc.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay risks related to ownership of our common stock the price of spherixs common stock has been highly volatile due to several factors which will continue to effect the price of our stock. our common stock has traded as low as . and as high as . between january and december . some of the factors leading to this volatility include relatively small amounts of our stock trading on any given day fluctuations in our operating results announcements of technological innovations or new products which we or our competitors make developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights. cornell capital partners will pay less than the market price and will have an incentive to sell its shares which may cause our stock price to decline. cornell capital partners will purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the standby equity distribution agreement seda at a purchase price that is less than the thenprevailing market price of our common stock. cornell capital partners will have an incentive to immediately sell any shares of our common stock that it purchases pursuant to the seda to realize a gain on the difference between the purchase price and the thenprevailing market price of our common stock. to the extent cornell capital partners sells its common stock the common stock price may decrease. new shareholders will experience significant dilution from our sale of shares under the seda. the sale of shares pursuant to the seda will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. as a result our net income per share could decrease in future periods and the market price of our common stock could decline. in addition the lower our stock price the more shares of common stock we will have to issue under the seda. if our stock price is lower then our existing stockholders would experience greater dilution. our common stock will be delisted from nasdaq global market system if we fail to comply with continued listing standards. we were previously advised that we were in danger of our common stock being delisted from the nasdaq global market due to our stockholders equity falling below the million minimum requirement. at december the companys shareholders equity was . million. if at some point we are unable to meet the listing standards we intend to apply to list our common stock on the nasdaq capital market. dividends on our common stock are not likely. we intend to retain future earnings if any in order to provide funds for use in the operation and expansion of our business and for further research and development. accordingly we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. investors must look solely to appreciation in the market price of the shares of our common stock to obtain a return on their investment. because of the rights agreement and antitakeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws a third party may be discouraged from making a takeover offer which could be beneficial to our stockholders. in we adopted a shareholder rights plan. the effect of this rights plan and of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation bylaws and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or replacing members of our board of directors even if the acquisition or the replacements would be beneficial to our stockholders. these factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of the common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. insiders own a significant portion of our common stock which could limit our stockholders ability to influence the outcome of key transactions . as of december our officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock. as a result our officers and directors are able to exert considerable influence over the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock including the election of our board of directors. the voting power of these stockholders could prevent or frustrate attempts to effect a transaction that is in the best interests of the other stockholders and could also discourage others from seeking to purchase our common stock which might depress the price of our common stock. seq.foliofilecfcdcc.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay we experience quarterly variations in our operating results. we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenue and operating income as a result of many factors including the seasonality of our information services business timing of customers budget processes and slowdowns or accelerations of work by customers. general work economic conditions may result in customer deferral of projects or cancellation in planned expenditures. these factors may adversely affect our financial results and our stock price. item b. unresolved staff comments none. item . properties in november

tagatose have been licensed to arla along with the rights to sell tagatose for food and beverage uses. our licensee has not been successful in marketing tagatose for food and beverage uses and has announced a cessation of further product manufacturing. accordingly we have focused our efforts on nonfood use of tagatose which we will market under the name naturlose. our principal efforts have

required to complete the trial in and if successful to file and pursue the fda application. the company has also outsourced to others preliminary testing of naturlose to establish an antiplaque claim for toothpaste. in the company contracted with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct human clinical trials on the oral antiplaque efficacy of naturlose. the study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria which form plaque than is sorbitol a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products. the study suggested ways of modifying the naturlose

accumulated and continuing foreign patent maintenance costs. accumulated patent maintenance costs were approximately at yearend. we have earned minimal royalties from arla in and . while tagatose has been introduced into several food and beverage products arla currently has insufficient sales volume and manufacturing capacity to produce tagatose at the rate necessary to generate meaningful

prices that impacted reservation sales on our park reservation contracts during the third quarter of . the division also saw a decrease in revenue of approximately . million between years as a result of the decrease in revenue under the new state of maryland contract that started november and the irs contract that ended in april . however these setbacks were more than offset by the divisions continued overall growth from the award of new contracts. the revenue growth was primarily driven by contracts such as the federal retirement thrift investment board that started in may the georgia

offset by the divisions continued overall growth. this revenue growth was primarily driven by contracts such as the federal retirement thrift investment board that started in may georgia that started in march and from increases under existing contracts such as ohio and the office of personnel management. the fourth quarter in particular saw a significant improvement over the prior year with an increase in revenue of as a result of increased revenue in the federal retirement thrift investment board contract and a general growth across the board on our existing reservation contracts. this combined with a reduction in direct costs of between the fourth quarter of and contributed to the improvement in operations between quarters. in spherix won park reservation contracts for orange county california the state of pennsylvania and the state of michigan. the orange county contract consists of three base years and is valued at less than half a million. the state of pennsylvania contract is a fiveyear contract consisting of one base year and four option years valued at approximately million. the state of michigan contract is a continuation of our current contract with the state. the new contract is for five years and consists of three base years plus two option years valued at approximately million. in march the company won a oneyear multimillion dollar federal retirement thrift investment board frtib contract with four option years. also on march the company purchased certain assets of daksoft inc. related to its reservation business which operates under

the company has operated since . the new contracts are for three years plus two additional option years. the combined maryland contracts contributed to the companys revenue in and in . the new contract started on november and is subject to a more competitive pricing structure which was necessary to win the recompete. while spherix was not the lowest bidder the companys higher technical scoring resulted in the company achieving an overall higher score than the competition. management is uncertain as to the longterm financial impact the price reduction will have over the course of the contract and believes that the lower rates may encourage the state to outsource more of its call center needs to spherix under this contract. the previous contract initially operated at a loss seq.foliofilecfcdce.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay during its first year and had matured to a respectable contribution margin by the time the contract ended in late . this increase was gained through the continued outsourcing of more of the states call center needs to spherix under the contract. the new contract which was bid at a lower contribution margin is the principal cause for the decrease in operating income between years. starting october as part of the cost reduction efforts the maryland contract began operating exclusively out of the companys cumberland office instead of the beltsville office and its margins for the fourth quarter were now consistent with our other contracts. revenue from commercial contracts decreased between years. commercial contracts are typically for shorter terms than government contracts and that can result in substantial variations in commercial revenue. commercial contracts are being pursued by the company but the companys recent history has been that contracts have been received on a sporadic basis. biospherix operations the decrease in the biospherix revenue from to between years was related to the discontinuance of the sale of flycracker in . sales backlog the companys funded and unfunded backlog as of december was million compared to million as of december . in the company won fiveyear contracts with the states of pennsylvania and michigan. critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported. estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses. actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. spherixs critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties. a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. such policies are discussed below. accounting for taxes and valuation allowances we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carry forwards. these deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods. based on the companys losses and its accumulated deficit the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset. a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances. we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable. longlived assets and other intangible assets longlived assets and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a longlived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the assets use and eventual disposition. seq.foliofilecfcdce.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay new accounting

incorporated with the outstanding borrowings under the old line of credit transferred to the new agreement. management considers the establishment of this credit facility for the subsidiary necessary to ensure timely cash flow for the subsidiarys operations. the new agreement which matures june provides for borrowings up to . million is collateralized by the subsidiarys accounts receivables and equipment and contains covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to ebitda ratios. such covenants could have a limiting effect on the amount of cash that the subsidiary can advance to spherix.

those related to the startup costs of new contracts the company may win. cash flow for the year ended december reflects a net cash inflow of . million consisting of . million provided by operating activities provided by investing activities and million provided by financing activities. the increase in cash provided by operating activities in from that of the prior year was primarily due to million settlement with the u.s. department of agriculture over the award of the nrrs contract. the increase in cash provided by investing activities was directly related to the expiration of restrictions on cash that was used as collateral on the companys lineofcredit in prior years and the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the result of proceeds raised from the issuance of stock under the seda agreement and the exercise of warrants. seq.foliofilecfcdcg.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay trends and outlooks infospherix the companys national park service contract

maryland effective december for use as a call center to replace the existing cumberland maryland facility. biospherix biospherixs primary emphasis is on a phase clinical trial to demonstrate that naturlose is a successful treatment for type diabetes. costs of conducting the phase trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the fda concerning the processes to

the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected. these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by managements override of the control. the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. periodic evaluation and conclusion. the company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the companys management including the companys chief executive officerchief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective pursuant to exchange act rule a. based upon that evaluation the chief executive officerchief financial officer concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. there were no significant changes in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect internal controls over financial reporting. item b. other information there was

website at www.spherix.com . item . executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis objectives of compensation program and what our compensation program is designed to reward our executive compensation program is designed to create strong financial incentive for our officers to increase revenue profit operating efficiency and returns which we expect to lead to an increase in shareholder value. the primary objective of our compensation program is to attract and retain qualified energetic employees who are enthusiastic about the companys mission. a further objective of our compensation program is to provide incentives and reward employees for their contribution to the company. in addition we strive to promote an ownership mentality among key leadership and the board of directors. finally we endeavor to ensure that our compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to all stakeholders. the compensation committee of the board of directors the committee evaluates both performance and compensation to ensure that the company maintains its ability to attract and retain superior employees in key positions and that compensation provided to key employees remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives of other companies. to that end the committee believes executive compensation packages provided by the company to its executives including the named executive officers should include both cash and stockbased components that reward performance as measured against established goals. our compensation program is designed to reward each employees contribution to the company. in measuring the named executive officers contribution to the company the committee considers numerous factors including the companys growth and financial performance. throughout this form k the individual who served as the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer during as well as the other individuals included in the summary compensation table on page are referred to as the named executive officers. immediately following this compensation discussion and analysis you will find a series of tables containing specific information about the compensation earned in by the named executive officers. roles and responsibilities for our compensation program role of the compensation committee the committee has responsibility for establishing implementing and monitoring adherence with the companys compensation philosophy. role of our chief executive officer our chief executive officer provides recommendations to the committee in its evaluation of our executive officers including recommendations of individual cash and equity compensation levels for executive officers. mr. levin relies on his personal experience serving in the capacity of chief executive officer with respect to evaluating the contribution of our other executive officers as well as publicly available information for comparable compensation guidance as the basis for his recommendations to the committee. mr. levin was not present during committee deliberations and voting pertaining to the determination of his own compensation. seq.foliofilecfcdcu.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay role of the compensation consultant the committee periodically retains a consultant to provide independent advice on executive compensation matters and to perform specific projectrelated work. elements of companys compensation plan the companys compensation program consists of base salary an annual incentive bonus stock incentivesawards health and welfare benefits and a k plan. the company strives to be market competitive in setting salary ranges and designing benefits programs while recognizing the experience and performance levels of individual employees. base salary the company provides named executive officers and other employees with base salary to compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year. base salary is the fixed annual compensation we pay to an executive for performing specific job responsibilities. it represents the minimum income an executive may receive in any given year. base salaries for named executive officers are determined for each executive based on position and responsibility. base salaries for each of the companys executives are determined by the executives responsibilities and performance as well as comparative compensation levels for the executives peers. the base salary for the companys chief executive officer including periodic changes thereto is determined by the committee. the base salaries for the companys other executive officers including periodic changes thereto are determined by the committee following recommendations by the chief executive officer. during its review of base salaries for executives the committee primarily considers market data internal review of the executives compensation both individually and relative to other officers individual performance of the executive and our financial and operating results. base salary levels are typically reviewed annually as part of the companys performance review process as well as upon a promotion or other change in job responsibility. annual bonus the compensation committee believes that a payforperformance bonus system must be the process to provide additional compensation for all spherix executives and that this bonus system must be based upon performance objectives developed from the long range business plan. the president and chief executive officer of spherix working with the executive staff set the performance bonus objectives. the boards function was to review to recommend modifications and to approve the objectives and the financial bonuses associated with those objectives. stock incentivesawards we currently administer longterm incentive compensation awards through our stock incentive plan. we believe that widespread common share ownership by key employees is an important means of encouraging superior performance and employee retention. in recent years this component of the companys executive compensation program has been via the periodic grant of stock options. the company generally has issued stock options to its executive officers when they joined the company in connection with a significant promotion within the company andor as a reward following excellent performance. the number of options granted has been based on the level of responsibility company performance and individual performance. stock option grants have also been structured to induce the executive to remain in the employment of the company by including incremental vesting provisions which permit exercise only after satisfaction of minimum tenure requirements. options are forfeited upon termination. seq.foliofilecfcdcu.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay health and welfare benefits we offer a standard range of health and welfare benefits to all employees including our executive officers. these benefits include medical prescription drug and dental coverages life insurance accidental death and dismemberment and longterm disability insurance. our plans do not discriminate in favor of our executive officers. k we offer a defined contribution k plan to substantially all of our employees. we provide this plan to assist our employees in saving some amount of their cash compensation for retirement in a tax efficient manner. other perquisites and personal benefits we do not offer any perquisites or other personal benefits to any executive with a value over . how compensation amounts are determined we strive to pay our named executive officers at or near the median paid by comparable companies. the compensation committee hired an outside company equilar inc. to compare the total compensation of the spherix executives to the total compensation of fourteen companies identified by equilar inc. to be peer companies to spherix. the equilar report on executive compensation showed that spherix executives are not compensated at the same level as colleagues in peer companies. based upon the fiscal health of spherix however it was determined by the compensation committee that no special efforts should be made to bring executive total compensation to equivalent levels of those in peer companies. all base salary increases with few exceptions should be kept in line with inflation. the compensation committee requested that the president and chief executive officer of spherix propose all executive salary increases but the overall spherix companywide increase should not be above inflation. with minor adjustments these recommendations were accepted by the full board. the compensation committee recommended to the board the salary adjustment for the president and chief executive officer of spherix. seq.foliofilecfcdcu.htmuserjmsproofassemblercdmay the following summary of compensation table sets forth the

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   General   Spherix Incorporated (the “Company” or “Registrant”), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1967.  The Company consists of a biotechnology segment (“BioSpherix”) and an information services segment (“InfoSpherix”).  At the May 2005 annual meeting shareholders approved the establishment of InfoSpherix as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spherix, which took effect January 2006.   The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 12051 Indian Creek Court, Beltsville, Maryland 20705, and its telephone number is (301) 419-3900.  The Company’s Common Stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Market system under the symbol SPEX.   Available Information   Our principal Internet address is  www.spherix.com .  We make available free of charge on  www.spherix.com  our annual, quarterly and current reports, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).   BioSpherix   This division is the Company’s biotechnology research and development arm, dedicated to developing proprietary products with a view toward commercial applications.  The Company has accumulated a number of patents on the products and processes developed by BioSpherix.  As set forth below, these products are in the development stage and will require substantial additional investment to bring any of these products to market.   Tagatose as a Low-Calorie, Full-Bulk Sweetener.   Spherix has patented the use of a naturally occurring sugar, tagatose, as a low-calorie, full-bulk sweetener.  It is a true sugar that looks, feels, and tastes like table sugar.  The Company has developed and patented a method for making tagatose from whey or lactose.  Whey is a waste product from cheese manufacturing.   2      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'2\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231418693_D11556_2133429\\\\14680-1-ca.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:14 2007\\'          The Firm has been developing its sweetener since receiving a U.S. patent for its use and manufacture as a low-calorie sweetener in 1988, which patent expired August 29, 2006.  The Company received two U.S. patents for its tagatose production process in 1991 and 1992, which both expire July 19, 2009.  It has received a number of foreign patents corresponding to these three and other U.S. patents.  These countries include Canada and Japan, both large potential markets.   In January 1997, the Company completed a license agreement with Arla Foods Ingredients amba (“Arla”) (formerly MD Foods Ingredients amba, “MDFI”) of Denmark for the exclusive, worldwide rights to market and distribute tagatose as a food and beverage ingredient in return for a non-refundable up-front payment and fees on net sales of the sugar for these purposes.  Arla manufactures a wide variety of dairy products, foods and food ingredients; it ranks as one of the largest dairy products manufacturers in the world.  Arla operates cheese plants producing large amounts of whey as a by-product.  The License Agreement and an amendment thereto provide Arla the world-wide right to manufacture and sell tagatose for food uses, and the right to manufacture tagatose for all uses.   A panel of experts retained by Arla declared tagatose as Generally Recognized As Safe (“GRAS”) on April 11, 2001, permitting sale of tagatose as a food ingredient in the U.S.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued a “no objection” letter on October 25, 2001.  Tagatose was recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) panel in June 2001 to its many member countries for use in foods, and in June 2004, JECFA removed its former limit on daily consumption of tagatose.  In 2003, approval was obtained in South Korea.  In April 2004, tagatose was approved by the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (“FSANZ”), the food health and safety agency for Australia and New Zealand.  In December 2005, tagatose was approved in the European Union.  Arla has begun the approval process for tagatose in Canada, Japan and Mexico.   The U.S. FDA approved Arla’s recommended caloric value of 1.5 kilocalories per gram, permitting labeling of products containing it as “reduced calorie” in the U.S.   In 2002, Arla formed a 50/50 joint venture with Nordzucker, a German sugar producer, for the manufacture and sale of tagatose.  The joint venture factory was capable of producing 1,200 metric tons per year.  At present Arla believes it has produced a sufficient backlog of inventory to satisfy its needs for the foreseeable future based on current demand, and accordingly has stopped production at its pilot plant until there is a sufficient increase in the demand for tagatose.  To date, Spherix has earned minimal royalties from Arla and given the cessation of production by Arla, Spherix does not currently expect to receive any future royalties.  With Spherix’s efforts focusing on the non-food potentials of Naturlose, the Company is pursing the possibility of recovering its technology from Arla or securing other production options.   Spherix retains the rights to the non-food uses to tagatose.  The Company has discovered and patented a number of health and medical uses for its product, which it has branded “Naturlose®” for uses in health and medicine as outlined below.  A priority among these patented uses is the use of Naturlose in treating Type 2 diabetes.   Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes.   Trials at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have found tagatose effective as a treatment of Type 2 diabetes in humans.  In addition to alleviating symptoms of this major disease, over the one-year trial, all subjects lost weight at physician-approved rates and showed a significant increase in the desirable type of cholesterol, HDL.  Other than for initial laxation at high doses (45 to 75 grams per capita per day), accommodated in about two weeks, no untoward effects were found in any of the research.  In addition, the studies found that Naturlose produced no rise in blood glucose or insulin levels in diabetic or normal subjects.  Naturlose taken before the consumption of glucose produced a blunting effect on the otherwise normally expected rise in blood glucose.   In late 2005, the FDA gave BioSpherix permission to begin a Phase 3 clinical trial for Naturlose as a stand-alone drug to treat diabetes.  Since then, BioSpherix’s research and development (R&D) activity has been focused primarily on planning and instituting the Phase 3 trial. The Phase 3 clinical trial is the last major test, if successful, before requesting drug approval.  The Company has negotiated two agreements with contract research organizations (CRO) to conduct the trial, and has retained Environ International, an FDA regulatory consultant, to guide the trial.   The Company has completed the dose range-finding study and will now proceed with recruiting patients for the trial, which will take place in Australia and the United States.  The first participants are expected to begin the Phase 3 clinical trial in April 2007.  More than 300 subjects from the United States and abroad, representing the demographic mix in the U.S., will receive oral doses of Naturlose to test its ability to treat Type 2 diabetes.  A Phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the FDA.  The Company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product; lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates.   3      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'3\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231418693_D11556_2133429\\\\14680-1-ca.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:14 2007\\'          Anti-plaque Agent :    In 2005, the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct human clinical trials on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.  The study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  The study suggested ways of modifying the Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction.  Such modifications have been made, and the Company has arranged with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt to establish an anti-plaque claim for the toothpaste.  The clinical trial started in early 2007.   Anti-hyperglycemic Agent.   Tagatose functions as an anti-hyperglycemic agent to prevent the formation of advanced glycosylation end-products, which is one of the major causes of aging.   Increasing the shelf life of stored blood, platelets and medicinal proteins.   The outsourced project seeking to establish the use of Naturlose to extend the shelf-life of blood fractions and various other medical products has been suspended as BioSpherix concentrates on the Type 2 diabetes trial.   Anemia and Hemophilia Treatment .  Naturlose has been shown to improve blood factors indicating that tagatose may be useful as a drug or drug adjuvant in the treatment of anemia and hemophilia.   Increased Fertility and Improved Fetal Development Drug.   Naturlose may increase the fertility of humans and other animals, to effect higher percentages of live fetuses, and to cause those fetuses to be heavier, but within normal bounds, than those of human or animal controls.   Preservative of Human Organs.   Naturlose has shown potential for use in the transplanting and storage of human organs to protect against cyto-oxidation and toxic chemicals.   Prototypes of Naturlose-based mouthwash, cough syrup, and a fiber digestive aid have been developed by BioSpherix.  Other projects are in the conceptual stage.   All of the potential uses mentioned above require further clinical trial studies and regulatory approval before they can be brought to market.   Capital for Development .  While the products under development show promise, continued progress is dependent upon many factors, including, but not limited to, the Company’s having sufficient funds and resources to pursue them.  Over its history, the Company has supported its research and development in part by using funds generated by InfoSpherix; however, due to the capital needs of InfoSpherix, and bank covenants restrictions, InfoSpherix may not be able to support the activities of BioSpherix.  Funds have also been raised from private placements of Company stock and warrants, some of the proceeds of which have been used to increase the state of development, market penetration and sales of the products mentioned above.  The Company believes that it will require substantial amounts of additional capital to develop and bring its BioSpherix products to market.  In order to fully develop, manufacture, distribute and sell Naturlose for these purposes, the Company is seeking to raise funds and will also seek a relationship with a major pharmaceutical company.   BioSpherix revenue accounted for less than 1% of the Company’s total revenue in 2006.   InfoSpherix Incorporated   In January 2006, the InfoSpherix business started operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spherix Incorporated under the name “InfoSpherix Incorporated.”   InfoSpherix  professionals design and operate contact centers, websites, and field kiosks providing information management and materials to the public on various socially beneficial subjects, as well as other information services, such as reservations and tourism.  InfoSpherix focuses on those clients who are looking to leverage technology in the ever-advancing world of information management.  InfoSpherix researches, collects, organizes and disseminates information by providing customized contact center services combining advanced data collection systems, expert decision support systems, tele-support utilizing live operators, and advanced telecommunication technologies such as   4      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'4\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231418693_D11556_2133429\\\\14680-1-ca.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:14 2007\\'          Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”).  InfoSpherix answers millions of calls annually from professionals and the public nationwide.  It operates a contact center in Cumberland, Maryland and a second contact center in Carmel, Indiana.  During 2006, the operations of the Rapid City, South Dakota contact center were relocated to Carmel, Indiana.  All contact centers efficiently manage and track high volumes of data.  Coupling InfoSpherix’s expert staff with its advanced technologies results in an effective system to collect and disseminate large amounts of information.  The Company also provides reservation services for campgrounds and other parks via its ReserveWorld business line.  Since 1998, InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to seventeen park reservation contracts.  InfoSpherix is one of only two major companies in this market.  In 2006, Spherix won a new park reservation contract, won the re-compete on two park reservation contracts, and will be the subcontractor on another.  InfoSpherix’s reservation business accounted for 64% of the Company’s revenue in 2006.   In October 2006, the Company agreed to a $6 million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the government’s award of a national park and reservation contract to ReserveAmerica.  The Company operated the National Park Service contract for nine years; revenue recognized was $4.0 million, $4.0 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, or 16%, 17% and 17% of total revenue for each year.  The Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.   InfoSpherix accounted for substantially all of the Company’s revenue in 2006.  Most of InfoSpherix’s revenue traditionally has been generated by a few large government contracts.  See Note 1, “Concentrations,” of the Notes to the consolidated Financial Statements included herein pursuant to Part II of this Form 10-K.   Government Contracts   See Note 10, “Commitment and Contingencies —  Government Contracts ,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements included herein pursuant to Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.   Government contracts typically have terms and conditions which, while providing annual or multi-year terms, subject them to termination upon convenience or default.   Industry Segments   See Note 13, “Information by Business Segment,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements included herein pursuant to Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for industry segment information of the Company, which information is incorporated herein by reference.   Market Concentration   During 2006, 2005, and 2004, essentially all of the Company’s revenue was generated by InfoSpherix.  The Company’s business operations are usually dependent upon substantial revenue from a select group of customers.  In 2006, 2005, and 2004, revenue from the U.S. Government, the State of Michigan and the State of Maryland each accounted for more than 10% of total Company revenue.   It is currently expected that revenue from the U.S. Government, the State of Michigan, the State of Maryland, and the State of Ohio will each account for more than 10% of total Company revenue in 2007.       5      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'5\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231418693_D11556_2133429\\\\14680-1-ca.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:14 2007\\'            Patents and Trademarks   The Company has established a strong worldwide patent position for tagatose.

Trademarks .  The Company has trademarked its name, “Spherix,” “ReserveWorld,” its reservation system, “FlyCracker,” its safe-for-humans pesticide, “Naturlose,” for non-food uses of tagatose, and “BioSpherix.”  It retains trademarks on its original name, “Biospherics,” and a former subsidiary, “Vitalian Corp.”   With respect to all of its inventions, the Company has received approximately 130 patents, including foreign issues.  It has several patents pending and many additional invention disclosures.  In addition to its strong patent position, the Company relies on the common law protection of such information as trade secrets and on confidentiality agreements to protect the value of these assets.   Seasonality   Revenue from reservation and tourism services is greatest in the spring and summer when vacation planning is the heaviest.  Revenue from other sources tends to be more evenly spread throughout the year, although the fourth quarter is historically the low period of the year.   Sales Backlog   Sales backlog, consisting of both funded and unfunded amounts, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, were as follows (in $000s):                         December 31, 2006               December 31, 2005                                   Current               Non-    Current               Total               Current               Non-    Current               Total                   InfoSpherix –   Government               $       20,800               $       36,000               $       56,800               $       24,100               $       48,200               $       72,300                   InfoSpherix –   Commercial               300               300               600               100               —               100                                   $       21,100               $       36,300               $       57,400               $       24,200               $       48,200               $       72,400                     As previously noted, the Company agreed to a $6 million settlement of its longstanding legal dispute over the award of the NRRS contract to ReserveAmerica.  As a result the Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.  Despite the loss of the National Park Service contract, the Company has developed a successful    6      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'6\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137221553113_D11892_2133240\\\\14680-1-cc.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 22:16 2007\\'          niche in providing government campground reservation services, growing from one to 17 reservation contracts over the past nine years and won the re-compete on two of its state reservation contracts.  The Company will continue to pursue its expansion into the state campground reservation niche.   Competition   InfoSpherix   The information systems industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change.  The Company is in competition with other information services companies across the nation.  Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources than the Company.  While acknowledging strong competition from other information services firms, the Company has developed a specialized niche by concentrating on high quality, personalized service combined with computerization for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  The Company has established a reputation for rapidly starting up information projects to meet its clients’ critical needs, while not compromising high quality and reasonable pricing.  The Company has also established a successful niche in government campground reservation services and is now one of only two major suppliers of campground services in the U.S.  The other major supplier is IAC/InterActiveCorp’s ReserveAmerica, a subsidiary of Ticketmaster.  Over the last three years, the Company has invested over $3 million in computer and telephony systems and nearly $3 million in the development of specialized computer software products to improve its competitive position.  The Company continues to upgrade and enhance those systems.   BioSpherix   Competitors of BioSpherix are numerous and include, among others, major pharmaceutical, chemical, consumer, and biotechnology companies, specialized firms, universities and other research institutions.  The Company’s competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that are being developed by the Company, and that could render the Company’s technology and potential products obsolete and noncompetitive.  Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the Company.   Research and Development   BioSpherix expenditures for research and development were approximately $884,000, $288,000, and $196,000 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.  These expenditures were incurred primarily in the ongoing efforts to commercialize Naturlose, including its development for drug uses and improved production processes.   Governmental Regulation   The business activities of the Company are subject to a variety of Federal and state compliance, licensing, and certification requirements.  Management believes that the Company is, and has been at all times, in full compliance with Federal and state environmental protection and worker safety laws.   The Company is also required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  On September 21, 2005, the SEC announced the extension of the compliance dates of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for non-accelerated filers.  Under the extension, non-accelerated filers, such as Spherix, will begin to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements for the first fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2007.  The Company anticipates that the cost of implementing Section 404 over the next two years could have a material impact on the results of operations.   Environment   Compliance with current federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had, and in the opinion of management will not have, a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures, cash flows or competitive position.   7      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'7\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137221553113_D11892_2133240\\\\14680-1-cc.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 22:16 2007\\'          Employees   In 2006, the Company employed an average of 588 individuals on a full- or part-time basis.  Of this total, approximately 344 were full-time employees.  The Company’s employees are not currently unionized, and management believes that its relation with the Company’s employees are harmonious.   Geographic Areas   InfoSpherix’s business is, and has been, based in the United States.  Accordingly, InfoSpherix revenue is entirely from U.S.-based operations.   Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS   Any of the risk factors we describe below could severely harm our business, financial condition and operating results.  The market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events.   RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS   WE CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON OUR INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION FOR ALL OF OUR REVENUE .  In each of 2006 and 2005, our information services segment accounted for nearly 100% of our revenue.  Despite licensing tagatose in 1996 for food and beverage use, our principal biotechnology product, we have yet to receive any substantial royalties from the sales of tagatose by our licensee.  We are actively pursuing various non-food uses of Naturlose, including as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  Thus, we have incurred substantial and continuing losses in our biotechnology segment which have adversely affected our overall financial results.  If we continue to be unsuccessful in commercializing our biotechnology products, our financial results will continue to be adversely affected to the detriment of our stock price.   OUR LARGEST INFORMATION SERVICES CONTRACT WAS AWARDED TO A COMPETITOR.   In October 2006, the Company agreed to a $6 million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the government’s award of the National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) contract to ReserveAmerica, a Ticketmaster subsidiary.  The Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract contributed $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006.  We will need to replace it with other work to avoid an adverse impact on our financial results.   OUR INFORMATION SERVICES BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTING OR FISCAL POLICIES OF THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.   We derive substantial revenue from contracts with the U.S. federal government and we believe that the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in U.S. federal government contract programs.  Accordingly, changes in U.S. federal government contracting policies could directly affect our financial performance.  Among the factors that could have a material adverse affect on our U.S. federal government contracting business are:   ·                    budgetary constraints affecting U.S. federal government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policies or available funding;   ·                    technological developments;   ·                    U.S. federal governmental shutdowns and other potential delays in the government appropriations process;   ·                    delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices due to problems with, or upgrades to, government information systems, or for other reasons;   ·                    competition and consolidation in the information services industry; and   ·                    general economic conditions.   OUR INFORMATION SERVICES BUSINESS IS RELIANT ON TECHNOLOGY.   We have devoted significant resources to developing and acquiring specialized hardware and software in our information services business.  In order to remain competitive, we must continue to select, invest in, acquire and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis.  We may not be successful in these efforts or in anticipating developments in technology.  In addition, competitors could develop similar applications.  Third parties could independently develop similar technology, obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary technology or misappropriate technology to which we have granted access.  Failure to remain current with technology or misappropriation of our technology could adversely affect our ability to compete for information services business and could lead to reduced business and reduced financial results.   8      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'8\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137221553113_D11892_2133240\\\\14680-1-cc.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 22:16 2007\\'          WE HAVE NOT YET SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZED NATURLOSE.   We are in the process of attempting to develop other uses of tagatose, under the brand name Naturlose, in non-food products such as a treatment for diabetes, toothpaste, mouthwash, and over-the-counter and pharmaceutical drugs.  Efforts are presently limited to the Type 2 diabetes clinical trial and toothpaste developments because of cash limitations.  To date, we have yet to secure any substantial revenue from Naturlose sales.  One of the hurdles we will have to overcome is that our foreign licensee for tagatose (which has the right to manufacture tagatose) does not currently have sufficient capacity to manufacture enough tagatose to supply both food and nonfood markets if such markets mature and grow.  Failure to successfully commercialize Naturlose may adversely affect our stock price.   OTHER BIOTECH PRODUCTS ARE STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE.   We are developing other biotech products.  None of these have been developed to a stage where any significant revenue has been generated.  Development of products will require significant additional research and development.  Such additional effort will require substantial funding which may not be available to us.  Further, our research and development activities may not result in any saleable products.  It is also possible that we will license or seek an affiliation with a third party to bring some products to market.  In such an event, we would likely have minimal control over the manufacture and marketing of such products.   DEVELOPMENT OF ANY BIOTECH PRODUCTS WILL DEPEND ON OBTAINING FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY APPROVALS.   Development of new products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries.  These rigorous regulatory approval processes can take five to ten years or more and require the expenditure of substantial resources.  We may not be able to obtain the necessary approvals for clinical testing or for the marketing of products.  Continuing failure to commercialize biotechnology products may adversely affect our financial results and stock price.   OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN PATENT PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS.   We have several patents for tagatose and other products under development.  We may not be able to obtain additional patents.  Further, future patents may not be held valid if subsequently challenged.  Failure to obtain and maintain patent protection for our biotechnology products may further delay or eliminate our ability to commercialize such products, which may adversely affect our financial results and stock price.   WE HAVE SUSTAINED LOSSES IN THE PAST AND WE MAY SUSTAIN LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.   We have incurred losses in prior years, including the years 2005 and 2004. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $2.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively.  Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, included $6 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture settlement.  We may not return to profitable operations.   WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THAT WE WILL NEED.   During 2006, our working capital increased by $7.7 million, largely as a result of proceeds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture settlement and proceeds from stock issuances.  In recent years, we have funded our operations through private placements of our common stock and through the exercise of warrants issued in connection with such private placement transactions.  We believe that we will need to raise additional funding to continue to finance our product development operations.  We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all.  Failure to obtain required financing may cause us to curtail or cease our operations.   WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN OUR KEY EXECUTIVES AND PERSONNEL.   As a small company, our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and other positions.  None of our key employees have employment agreements.  The loss of the services of one or more of such employees could have a material adverse effect on us.   WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION BY COMPETITORS IN BOTH DIVISIONS.   Our competitors in the information services business are numerous.  Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.  Our principal information services competitor, ReserveAmerica, is a division of Ticketmaster which is a subsidiary of IAC/InterActive Corp., a significantly larger public company than Spherix.  Our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and biotechnology products that are more effective than ours.   9      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'9\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137221553113_D11892_2133240\\\\14680-1-cc.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 22:16 2007\\'          RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK   THE PRICE OF SPHERIX’S COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN HIGHLY VOLATILE DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO EFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK.   Our common stock has traded as low as $1.18 and as high as $3.92 between January 2, 2006 and December 29, 2006. Some of the factors leading to this volatility include:   ·                    relatively small amounts of our stock trading on any given day;   ·                    fluctuations in our operating results;   ·                    announcements of technological innovations or new products which we or our competitors make;   ·                    developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights.   CORNELL CAPITAL PARTNERS WILL PAY LESS THAN THE MARKET PRICE AND WILL HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO SELL ITS SHARES, WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.   Cornell Capital Partners will purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (SEDA) at a purchase price that is less than the then-prevailing market price of our common stock.  Cornell Capital Partners will have an incentive to immediately sell any shares of our common stock that it purchases pursuant to the SEDA to realize a gain on the difference between the purchase price and the then-prevailing market price of our common stock.  To the extent Cornell Capital Partners sells its common stock, the common stock price may decrease.   NEW SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DILUTION FROM OUR SALE OF SHARES UNDER THE SEDA.   The sale of shares pursuant to the SEDA will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders.  As a result, our net income per share could decrease in future periods, and the market price of our common stock could decline.  In addition, the lower our stock price, the more shares of common stock we will have to issue under the SEDA.  If our stock price is lower, then our existing stockholders would experience greater dilution.   OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE DELISTED FROM NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET SYSTEM IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS.   We were previously advised that we were in danger of our common stock being delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market due to our stockholders’ equity falling below the $10 million minimum requirement.  At December 31, 2006, the Company’s shareholder’s equity was $14.6 million.  If at some point we are unable to meet the listing standards, we intend to apply to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market.   DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK ARE NOT LIKELY.   We intend to retain future earnings, if any, in order to provide funds for use in the operation and expansion of our business and for further research and development.  Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.  Investors must look solely to appreciation in the market price of the shares of our common stock to obtain a return on their investment.   BECAUSE OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND “ANTI-TAKEOVER” PROVISIONS IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, A THIRD PARTY MAY BE DISCOURAGED FROM MAKING A TAKEOVER OFFER WHICH COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.   In 2001, we adopted a shareholder rights plan.  The effect of this rights plan and of certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or replacing members of our board of directors, even if the acquisition or the replacements would be beneficial to our stockholders.  These factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of the common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.   INSIDERS OWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR STOCKHOLDERS’ ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF KEY TRANSACTIONS .  As of December 31, 2006, our officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.  As a result, our officers and directors are able to exert considerable influence over the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, including the election of our Board of Directors.  The voting power of these stockholders could prevent or frustrate attempts to effect a transaction that is in the best interests of the other stockholders and could also discourage others from seeking to purchase our common stock, which might depress the price of our common stock.   10      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'10\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137221553113_D11892_2133240\\\\14680-1-cc.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 22:16 2007\\'          WE EXPERIENCE QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS.   We have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenue and operating income as a result of many factors, including the seasonality of our information services business, timing of customers’ budget processes and slowdowns or accelerations of work by customers.  General work economic conditions may result in customer deferral of projects or cancellation in planned expenditures.  These factors may adversely affect our financial results and our stock price.   Item 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS   None.   Item 2.  PROPERTIES   In November 1997, the Company signed a lease agreement effective May 1, 1998, for 51,625 square feet of office, call center, research labs, and warehouse space in the same Beltsville, Maryland, facility previously occupied, under the terms of a lease that expires on February 28, 2009.  This facility contains corporate administration, human resources, accounting, sales and marketing, technical services and warehousing, for support of both InfoSpherix and BioSpherix, and through September 2005 contained call center operations for InfoSpherix.   In November 2003, the Company signed a lease agreement for 31,526 square feet of office and call center space in Cumberland, Maryland.  This lease has been extended to coincide with the Company’s move from this facility to another facility in the area, but no later than February 28, 2008.  The new lease agreement for 32,423 square feet of office and call center space in Frostburg, Maryland, was signed in February 2007.  The lease is targeted to commence December 1, 2007, and expire November 30, 2017.   In 2004, as part of its acquisition of certain assets of Daksoft, Inc.’s reservation business, the Company signed an agreement to lease 8,280 square feet of call center space in Rapid City, South Dakota.  The lease expired December 31, 2006.   In 2006, the Company signed an agreement to lease up to 18,601 square feet of call center space in Carmel, Indiana, effective April 1, 2006.  The lease expires December 31, 2011.  During 2006, the operations of the Rapid City, South Dakota facility were transferred to the Carmel, Indiana facility.   In 2004, the Company signed an agreement to lease 5,000 square feet of office, research lab and warehouse space for BioSpherix in Annapolis, Maryland.  The lease expires June 30, 2009.   Throughout 2006, the Beltsville, Carmel and Annapolis facilities had sufficient capacity.  The Cumberland and Rapid City facilities were operating at an estimated 75%-90% capacity during the peak months.   Item 3.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.                   The Company’s common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market and is quoted in the NASDAQ Global Market System under the symbol SPEX.  No cash dividends have been paid.                   As of March 10, 2007, the number of shareholders of record of the Company’s common stock was approximately 7,000.  The following table states the high and low sales prices of the Company’s common stock for each quarter during the two year period ended December 31, 2006, based on the daily closing prices as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market System:            SET mrlHTMLTableCenter                High               Low                   1st Quarter 2006               $       3.920               $       2.000                   2nd Quarter 2006               $       3.090               $       1.510                   3rd Quarter 2006               $       2.320               $       1.340                   4th Quarter 2006               $       2.710               $       1.330                                                                       1st Quarter 2005               $       3.940               $       2.540                   2nd Quarter 2005               $       3.029               $       1.500                   3rd Quarter 2005               $       2.150               $       1.370                   4th Quarter 2005               $       5.850               $       1.190                                       The Company recognized that, as of June 30, 2005, it was approximately $454,000 short of meeting NASDAQ’s Global Market listing requirement of maintaining a minimum of $10,000,000 in shareholders’ equity.  NASDAQ gave the Company until September 1, 2005, to correct this situation, which the Company achieved through its third quarter results.  However, in anticipation of incurring losses due to seasonal fluctuations in the InfoSpherix business segment that occur in the first and fourth quarters of the year, the Company, on July 22, 2005, entered into a Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (“SEDA”) with Cornell Capital Partners, L.P. (“Cornell”).  Under the SEDA, Spherix can require Cornell to purchase up to $4,000,000 of the Company’s common stock over a two-year period following the effective date, October 12, 2005, of the registration covering the shares of our common stock to be sold to Cornell.  The SEDA establishes what is sometimes termed an “equity line of credit” or an “equity draw-down facility.”  The $4,000,000 facility may be drawn down upon by us in installments, the maximum amount of each draw down is limited to $350,000.  For each share of common stock purchased under the SEDA, Cornell will pay 95% of the lowest volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of our shares during the five trading days following our draw down notice to Cornell.  The VWAP used in the calculation is that reported by Bloomberg, LLC, a third-party reporting service.  In general, the VWAP represents the sum of the value of all the sales of our common stock for a given day (the total shares sold in each trade times the sales price per share of the common stock for that trade), divided by the total number of our shares sold on that day.  We are also committed to pay to Cornell an amount equal to 5% of each purchase of our common stock made by Cornell under the SEDA.  Under the terms of the SEDA agreement, we are not obligated to draw down on the SEDA facility, but once we satisfy normal conditions for this type of transaction, we have the right to require Cornell to purchase our common shares under the SEDA.  In connection with the SEDA, we have issued to Cornell 95,000 shares of our common stock and paid a due diligence fee of $5,000.  We also paid Yorkville Advisors Management, LLC, the investment manager for Cornell, a structuring fee of $15,000, and on each sale under the SEDA we will pay an additional structuring fee of $500.  Newbridge Securities Corporation acted as our placement agent for the SEDA, and we paid that firm a fee of 5,000 shares of our common stock as compensation valued at approximately $10,000.  We also granted Newbridge Securities Corporation piggy-back registration rights covering these shares.  Registration of our common shares allocated to this facility was completed in October 2005.  During the term of the SEDA, our Officers and Directors have agreed not to sell any of their shares of our common stock, except to the extent permitted under Rule 144.  The number of shares of our common stock issuable to Cornell under the SEDA is subject to a 9.99% cap on the beneficial ownership that Cornell and its affiliates may have at the time of each sale (beneficial ownership is to be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).  Further, we may not issue more than 19.99% of our currently outstanding shares under the SEDA unless shareholder approval is received.  In 2006 and 2005, the Company sold 819,453 and 310,076 shares under the SEDA agreement for total proceeds of $1,896,500 and $376,500, respectively.   12      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'12\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231645970_D11556_2133445\\\\14680-1-ce.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:17 2007\\'                          On February 18, 2004, warrants for 500,000 shares of Common Stock were exercised at $6.91 per share, compared to the then current market price of $6.76 per share, by an institutional investor, and the expiration date of the remaining 585,973 warrants was extended until February 25, 2008, at an exercise price of $7.00 per share of common stock.  The remaining warrants were assigned and transferred to another institutional investor in 2004.  On March 9, 2006, in exchange for the Company’s agreement to reduce the exercise price to $2.04 per share, the Investor agreed to exercise the warrants for the full 585,973 shares for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.  In connection with these warrants, the Investor agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to the extent that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that their holdings in the Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock.  The warrants and shares of Common Stock were issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.  The Company has registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by the institutional Investor.                       At December 31, 2006, the Company’s shareholder’s equity was $14.6 million.       The Company has a share repurchase program in place that initially authorized the purchase of up to $1,000,000 of the Company’s shares in the open market.  To date, only 34,750 shares aggregating $160,000 of the Company’s shares have been repurchased.  There was no repurchase activity during 2005 or 2006.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Overview                       The Company operates via two principal segments, BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.  BioSpherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications.  InfoSpherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry.                       InfoSpherix generates substantially all of the Company’s revenue.  In 2006, 2005, and 2004, InfoSpherix generated substantially all of its revenue from government customers.  The Company has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its ReserveWorld business line, which accounted for approximately 64%, 62%, and 58% of the Company’s revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004.  During 2006, the Company won a reservation contract for the State of Maine, and the re-compete of the contracts from the States of Indiana and Minnesota.  The Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.                       BioSpherix engages in product development, notably tagatose.  The rights to manufacture tagatose have been licensed to Arla along with the rights to sell tagatose for food and beverage uses.  Our licensee has not been successful in marketing tagatose for food and beverage uses and has announced a cessation of further product manufacturing.  Accordingly, we have focused our efforts on non-food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name “Naturlose”.  Our principal efforts have been to explore whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  We are about to commence a Phase 3 clinical trial for this purpose.       Results of Operations ¾ 2006 Compared with 2005                       In 2006, the Company reported a net income of $3.5 million ($0.26 per diluted share) on revenue of $24.8 million for the year, compared with a net loss of $2.8 million ($0.24 per diluted share) on revenue of $23 million in 2005.       Revenue       The Company experienced a $1.8 million (8%) increase in revenue between years as a result of InfoSpherix’s State of Pennsylvania campground reservation contract that was awarded to the Company in 2005 and became operational at the beginning of 2006.        Direct Contract and Operating Costs                       Direct contract and operating costs increased $431,000 (2%) between years with the addition of the State of Pennsylvania contract.       Selling, General and Administrative                       Selling, general and administrative expense (“S,G&A”) for 2006 increased by $360,000 (7%) as the result of increased legal costs relating to the Company’s challenge of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s award of the NRRS contract to another competitor, as noted above.       Research and Development                       Research and development costs increased $595,000 between years.  The Company is focusing its efforts on the development of Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  In 2006, the Company expended approximately $780,000 in preparation for the Phase 3 clinical trial which is expected to commence in April 2007.  The Phase 3 clinical trial is expected to take at least two (2) years to complete.  If the Phase 3 clinical trial is successful, the Company will submit an appropriate drug application to the FDA.   15      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'15\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231645970_D11556_2133445\\\\14680-1-ce.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:17 2007\\'                              The cost of preparing for and conducting the Phase 3 trial has substantially increased as the Company has increased the number of participants and the FDA requested a change in the form of delivery of the drug to the participants.  The Company estimates that it could expend up to $5 million in 2007 in furtherance of this trial.  Additional sums will be required to complete the trial in 2008 and, if successful, to file and pursue the FDA application.                       The Company has also outsourced to others preliminary testing of Naturlose to establish an anti-plaque claim for toothpaste.  In 2005, the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct human clinical trials on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.  The study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  The study suggested ways of modifying the Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction.  Such modifications have been made, and the Company has negotiated with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt to establish an anti-plaque claim for the toothpaste.  The clinical trial started in early 2007.       Other Income                       In October 2006, the Company agreed to a $6 million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the government’s award of the National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) contract to ReserveAmerica, a Ticketmaster subsidiary.  The Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.       InfoSpherix Operations                       The following schedule summarizes the breakdown of InfoSpherix revenue between government and commercial contracts (in $000s):                SET mrlHTMLTableCenter                For the Year Ended December 31                                   2006               2005                                                                       Government               $       24,699               $       22,935                   Commercial               132               88                                   $       24,831               $       23,023                                       As noted above, InfoSpherix revenue for 2006 increased $1.8 million (8%) over that of the prior year.         During 2006, the Company won a reservation contract from the State of Maine, and the re-compete of the contracts from the States of Indiana and Minnesota.  The Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.  The Company operated the NPRS contract for nine years; revenue recognized was $4.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, and 2005, or 16% and 17% of total revenue for each year.  Park reservation contracts during 2006 and 2005 made up over 60% of the Company’s revenue and the Company is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the U.S.       Starting October 1, 2005, as part of the cost reduction efforts, the Maryland information center contracts began operating exclusively in the Company’s Cumberland office instead of the Beltsville office, and its margins for the fourth quarter of 2005 and for all of 2006 are now consistent with our other contracts.                       Currently, the Company is bidding on several contracts and expects to bid on more contracts throughout the coming year, although no assurance can be given at this time that these efforts will result in new business for the Company.          BioSpherix Operations                       BioSpherix is entitled to high end royalties from Arla’s sales of tagatose until at least 2011, and, depending upon certain conditions, until 2016.  The payments are net of accumulated and continuing foreign patent maintenance costs.  Accumulated patent maintenance costs were approximately $213,000 at year-end.  We have earned minimal royalties from Arla in 2006, 2005, and 2004.  While tagatose has been introduced into several food and beverage products, Arla currently has insufficient sales volume and manufacturing capacity to produce tagatose at the rate necessary to generate meaningful royalties.  At present, Arla believes it has produced a sufficient backlog of inventory to satisfy its needs for the foreseeable future based on current demand, and accordingly has stopped production at its plant.  Spherix is also pursing the possibility of other production options.   16      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'16\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231645970_D11556_2133445\\\\14680-1-ce.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:17 2007\\'                              The Company is focusing its efforts on the development of Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  In 2006, the Company expended approximately $780,000 in preparation for the Phase 3 clinical trial which is expected to commence in April 2007.  The Phase 3 clinical trial is expected to take at least two (2) years to complete.  If the Phase 3 clinical trial is successful, the Company will submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA.  Approval would allow the product to be sold for its intended use to treat Type 2 diabetes.  The Company would seek to partner with or license a major drug firm for such commercialization.                       The cost of preparing for and conducting the Phase 3 trial has substantially increased as the FDA has provided more stringent parameters for the trial.  The Company estimates that it could expend up to $5 million in 2007 in furtherance of this trial.  Additional sums will be required to complete the trial in 2008 and, if successful, to file and pursue the FDA application.                       The Company has also outsourced to others preliminary testing of Naturlose to establish an anti-plaque claim for toothpaste.        Sales Backlog                    The Company’s funded and unfunded backlog as of December 31, 2006, was $57 million, compared to $72 million as of December 31, 2005.  In 2006, the Company won a reservation contract from the State of Maine, and the re-compete of the contracts from the States of Indiana and Minnesota.  The NPS contract ended in January 2007.       Results of Operations ¾ 2005 Compared with 2004                       In 2005, the Company reported a net loss of $2.8 million ($0.24 per diluted share) on revenue of $23.0 million for the year, compared with a net loss of $2.8 million ($0.24 per diluted share) on revenue of $22.3 million in 2004.       Revenue                       Revenue between years increased $697,000 (3%).  Revenue from the InfoSpherix Division increased $802,000 (4%) and the BioSpherix Division’s revenue decreased by $104,000 (82%).  The increased revenue from the InfoSpherix Division was less than anticipated as a result of an unexpected temporary funding shortage on one of our major Federal contracts that lasted for a period of four months until the Federal Government’s fiscal year ended September 2005, and from hurricanes and the rise in gasoline prices that impacted reservation sales on our park reservation contracts during the third quarter of 2005.  The Division also saw a decrease in revenue of approximately $2.9 million between years as a result of the decrease in revenue under the new State of Maryland contract that started November 2004 and the IRS contract that ended in April 2004.  However, these set-backs were more than off-set by the division’s continued overall growth from the award of new contracts.  The revenue growth was primarily driven by contracts such as the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board that started in May 2004, the Georgia contract that started in March 2004, and from increases under existing contracts with the state of Ohio and the Office of Personnel Management.  The decrease in BioSpherix revenue was related to the discontinuance of the sale of FlyCracker in 2004.       Direct Contract and Operating Costs                       Direct contract and operating costs increased $863,000 (4%) between years.  This increase included the recognition of a forward loss provision of $135,000 on one of the Company’s contracts.  The increase is also attributed to approximately $100,000 in start-up costs related to the new State of Pennsylvania contract that began in January 2006.  South Dakota operations operated at a break-even for 2005, up $100,000 from 2004.       Selling, General and Administrative                       Selling, general and administrative expense (“S,G&A”) for 2005 decreased by $217,000 (4%) from that of the prior year.  In 2005, the Company cut its consulting costs by approximately $265,000, most of which were related to marketing.   17      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'17\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231645970_D11556_2133445\\\\14680-1-ce.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:17 2007\\'          Research and Development                       Research and development costs increased $92,000 between years.  In 2004, the BioSpherix Division began a program of outsourcing development of its patented drug uses of Naturlose.  A research project was funded at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to follow up on that institution’s discovery that Naturlose may lengthen shelf life of stored blood fractions and medicinal proteins.  In 2005, the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct human clinical trials on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.  The study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  Contrary to earlier laboratory findings by Spherix, however, a human study at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry did not show anti-plaque activity.  Conditions in the mouth may have prevented the desired effect, according to the University researchers.  Spherix is following up on corrective suggestions made by the University, and plans to conduct new human trials.       InfoSpherix Operations                       The following schedule summarizes the breakdown of InfoSpherix revenue between government and commercial contracts (in $000s):                SET mrlHTMLTableCenter                For the Year Ended December 31                                   2005               2004                                                                       Government               $       22,935               $       22,054                   Commercial               88               167                                   $       23,023               $       22,221                                       As noted above, InfoSpherix revenue for 2005 increased $802,000 (4%) over that of the prior year.  The increased revenue from the InfoSpherix Division was less than anticipated as a result of an unexpected temporary funding shortage on one of our major Federal contracts that lasted for a period of four months until the Federal Government’s fiscal year ended September 2005, and from hurricanes and the rise in gasoline prices that impacted reservation sales on our park reservation contracts during the third quarter of 2005.  The Division also saw a decrease in revenue of approximately $2.9 million between years from the decrease in revenue under the new State of Maryland contract that started November 2004, and the IRS contract that ended in April 2004.  However, these set-backs were more than off-set by the division’s continued overall growth.  This revenue growth was primarily driven by contracts such as the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board that started in May 2004, Georgia that started in March 2004, and from increases under existing contracts such as Ohio and the Office of Personnel Management.  The fourth quarter in particular saw a significant improvement over the prior year, with an increase in revenue of $399,000 as a result of increased revenue in the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board contract and a general growth across the board on our existing reservation contracts.  This combined with a reduction in direct costs of $139,000 between the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, contributed to the $472,000 improvement in operations between quarters.       In 2005, Spherix won park reservation contracts for Orange County, California, the State of Pennsylvania, and the State of Michigan.  The Orange County contract consists of three base years and is valued at less than half a million.  The State of Pennsylvania contract is a five-year contract, consisting of one base year and four option years, valued at approximately $8 million.  The State of Michigan contract is a continuation of our current contract with the State.  The new contract is for five years, and consists of three base years plus two option years, valued at approximately $14 million.                       In March 2004, the Company won a one-year, multi-million dollar Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (“FRTIB”) contract with four option years.  Also, on March 1, 2004, the Company purchased certain assets of Daksoft, Inc. related to its reservation business, which operates under the name “ReserveIt.”  The purchase included the acquisition of six additional government reservation contracts and the intellectual property rights to the name “ReserveIt,” as well as other assets of the division.  Spherix purchased the assets for $700,000 plus 43,029 shares of the Company’s common stock, then trading at $6.699 per share.                       In 2004, the Company won the re-procurement of the Maryland information center contracts, which the company has operated since 1998.  The new contracts are for three years plus two additional option years.  The combined Maryland contracts contributed 12% to the Company’s revenue in 2005 and 22% in 2004.  The new contract started on November 1, 2004, and is subject to a more competitive pricing structure, which was necessary to win the re-compete.  While Spherix was not the lowest bidder, the Company’s higher technical scoring resulted in the Company achieving an overall higher score than the competition.  Management is uncertain as to the long-term financial impact the price reduction will have over the course of the contract and believes that the lower rates may encourage the state to outsource more of its call center needs to Spherix under this contract.  The previous contract initially operated at a loss    18      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'18\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231645970_D11556_2133445\\\\14680-1-ce.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:17 2007\\'          during its first year and had matured to a respectable contribution margin by the time the contract ended in late 2004.  This increase was gained through the continued outsourcing of more of the state’s call center needs to Spherix under the contract.  The new contract, which was bid at a lower contribution margin, is the principal cause for the decrease in operating income between years.  Starting October 1, 2005, as part of the cost reduction efforts, the Maryland contract began operating exclusively out of the Company’s Cumberland office instead of the Beltsville office, and its margins for the fourth quarter were now consistent with our other contracts.                       Revenue from commercial contracts decreased between years.  Commercial contracts are typically for shorter terms than government contracts and that can result in substantial variations in commercial revenue.  Commercial contracts are being pursued by the Company, but the Company’s recent history has been that contracts have been received on a sporadic basis.       BioSpherix Operations                       The $104,000 decrease in the BioSpherix revenue from $127,000 to $23,000 between years was related to the discontinuance of the sale of FlyCracker in 2004.         Sales Backlog                       The Company’s funded and unfunded backlog as of December 31, 2005, was $72 million, compared to $61 million as of December 31, 2004.  In 2005, the Company won five-year contracts with the States of Pennsylvania and Michigan.        Critical Accounting Estimates                       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported.  Estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  These estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses.  Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates.                       Spherix’s critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results, and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties.  A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  Such policies are discussed below.       Accounting for Taxes and Valuation Allowances                       We currently have significant deferred tax assets, resulting from net operating loss carry forwards.  These deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods.  Based on the Company’s losses and its accumulated deficit, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset.  A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances.                        We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained, or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable.        Long-Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets                       Long-lived assets and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset’s use and eventual disposition.       19      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'19\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137231645970_D11556_2133445\\\\14680-1-ce.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:17 2007\\'            New Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN48”).  The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”  We are required to adopt FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007.  We are currently evaluating the impact this interpretation will have on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.   In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).  SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  We are required to adopt SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material affect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”).  SAB 108 addresses diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet.  The bulletin requires companies to quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of their financial statements and related disclosures.  We have adopted SAB 108 in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   On March 31, 2006, the Company entered into a new agreement with Bank of America (“the Bank”) to establish a line-of-credit (“New Agreement”) for its subsidiary, InfoSpherix Incorporated, with the outstanding borrowings under the old line of credit transferred to the new agreement.  Management considers the establishment of this credit facility for the subsidiary necessary to ensure timely cash flow for the subsidiary’s operations.  The New Agreement, which matures June 30, 2008, provides for borrowings up to $1.5 million, is collateralized by the subsidiary’s accounts receivables and equipment, and contains covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.  Such covenants could have a limiting effect on the amount of cash that the subsidiary can advance to Spherix.  The interest rate under the Agreement is based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.34% at December 31, 2006).  The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at December 31, 2006, and the total amount available for future advance to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under the Agreement.   Working capital as of December 31, 2006, was $10.9 million, which represents a $7.8 million increase from working capital of $3.1 million at December 31, 2005.  The increase in working capital between years was largely related to the U.S. Department of Agriculture settlement.   Spherix expects to expend up to $5 million over the next year in costs related to the Phase 3 clinical trial.   InfoSpherix Incorporated intends to finance its furniture and equipment needs through financing or leasing arrangements where practicable, including those related to the start-up costs of new contracts the Company may win.   Cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006, reflects a net cash inflow of $8.3 million, consisting of $6.7 million provided by operating activities, $586,000 provided by investing activities, and $1 million provided by financing activities.  The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 from that of the prior year was primarily due to $6 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the award of the NRRS contract.  The increase in cash provided by investing activities was directly related to the expiration of restrictions on cash that was used as collateral on the Company’s line-of-credit in prior years, and the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the result of proceeds raised from the issuance of stock under the SEDA agreement and the exercise of warrants.   20      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'20\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137223217677_D11892_2133240\\\\14680-1-cg.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 22:32 2007\\'          Trends and Outlooks   InfoSpherix   ·                    The Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.   ·                    In 2006, the Company won the re-compete on its park reservation services to the States of Indiana and Minnesota and recently won a new state park reservation contract for the State of Maine and will be a subcontractor on another contract.   ·                    Since 1998, InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to 17 government reservation contracts.  InfoSpherix’s reservation business accounted for over 60% of the Company’s revenue in 2006 and 2005.  InfoSpherix is now one of only two major suppliers of Government campground reservation services in the U.S.   ·                    On February 6, 2007, the Company signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet of facility space in Frostburg, Maryland effective December 1, 2007, for use as a call center to replace the existing Cumberland, Maryland facility.   BioSpherix   ·                    BioSpherix’s primary emphasis is on a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose is a successful treatment for Type 2 diabetes.   ·                    Costs of conducting the Phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed in the trial.  The Company is exploring all of its alternatives to generate sufficient funds to complete the Phase 3 trial, to further develop Naturlose as a diabetes treatment if the Phase 3 trial is successful, and to further commercialize Naturlose for other uses.   Contractual Obligations   The following table summarizes the Company’s known contractual obligations at December 31, 2006, and indicates the year payments are due.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   The Company manages its debt and its available cash by considering available investment opportunities, risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies.   At December 31, 2006, the Company did not have any fixed-rate or variable-rate indebtedness.  The Company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness.   Cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds, which generally mature in 30 days, or money-market funds.  In general, such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.  The carrying amounts approximate market value.  It is the Company’s practice to hold these investments to maturity.   Assuming year-end 2006 variable rate debt and cash available for investment, a one percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than $100,000.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   As discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, “ Share-Based Payment ,” effective January 1, 2006.   /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP   McLean,

Notes to Financial Statements   1.             Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Nature of Business   On January 1, 2006, Spherix Incorporated transferred the assets of its information services segment (the “InfoSpherix Division”) to a new wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoSpherix Incorporated (“InfoSpherix”).  Spherix Incorporated (“Spherix”) was founded in 1967, and both Companies are incorporated in Delaware.  The activities of the biotechnology segment (“BioSpherix”) continue to operate through Spherix Incorporated.  BioSpherix is dedicated to research, development, and productization of proprietary products.  InfoSpherix operates contact center services providing consulting, information management, and materials management to the public as well as reservation and tourism solutions.  These services are provided primarily under government contracts.  The Company maintains three facilities in Maryland, including its corporate headquarters in Beltsville, and one facility in Indiana.   Basis of Presentation   Beginning January 1, 2006, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of both Spherix Incorporated and InfoSpherix Incorporated (collectively, the “Company”).  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.   Use of Estimates and Assumptions   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.   Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  At December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $6.5 million invested in treasury funds with a maturity of three months or less, which are included as cash and cash equivalents.  The Company maintains cash balances at several banks.  Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $100,000.  At December 31, 2006, the Company’s cash and cash equivalent in excess of the FDIC limits was $10,751,000.   Concentrations   During 2006, revenue from three major government contracts accounted for 16%, 15%, and 11% of the Company’s total revenue.  No other contracts were greater than 10%.  At December 31, 2006, four major contracts constituted 68% of the trade accounts receivable, the components of which were 26%, 16%, 15% and 11%.  No other single contract was greater than 10% of total trade accounts receivable.  Receivables from Federal and state government agencies represented 83% of the total trade accounts receivable.   During 2005, revenue from four major government contracts accounted for 17%, 16%, 12%, and 12% of the Company’s total revenue.  No other contracts were greater than 10%.  At December 31, 2005, four major contracts constituted 75% of the trade accounts receivable, the components of which were 30%, 16%, 15% and 14%.  No other single contract was greater than 10% of total trade accounts receivable.  Receivables from Federal and state government agencies represented 91% of the total trade accounts receivable.  Government contracts accounted for approximately 99%, 100%, and 99% of the InfoSpherix revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.   Property and Equipment and Depreciation   Property and equipment are stated at cost and consist of office furniture and equipment, computer hardware and software, leasehold improvements, and capital leases.  Computer hardware and software include the cost of internally developed software programs, which have long-term benefits.  The Company has developed and continues to develop a large variety of software applications that are used in the performance of its multiple contact center and park reservation contracts.  These applications are designed to aid our telephone operators in providing information to the public as well as collecting caller information.  The Company has also developed software applications that we use to   28      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'28\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\141162541688_D11854_2138720\\\\14680-1-co.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 21 16:25 2007\\'      process park reservation transactions.  The Company capitalizes the labor and fringe costs incurred by our software programmers in the development of these applications as well as the costs incurred in creating functionality enhancements.  In 2006 and 2005, the Company capitalized approximately $790,000 and $804,000 in internally developed software, respectively.  The Company computes depreciation and amortization under the straight-line method and typically over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets:            SET mrlHTMLTableCenter  Office furniture and   equipment               3   to 10 years                   Computer hardware and   software               3 to 5 years                       Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally 5 to 10 years).  Major additions, improvements and renewals are capitalized and ordinary repairs, maintenance, and renewals are expensed in the year incurred.  Gains or losses from the sale or retirement of property and equipment result from the difference between sales proceeds (if any) and the assets’ net book value, and are recorded in the consolidated Statement of Operations.   Inventory   Included in prepaid expenses at December 31, 2006, is approximately $65,000 of Naturlose inventory.  The inventory is valued at lower of cost or market.   Deferred Rent   The Company entered into leases for its Beltsville, Cumberland, Annapolis and Indianapolis facilities in 1997, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively.  The excess of the rent expense over the cash payments for rent is recorded as deferred rent and is being amortized over the life of the leases.   Research and Development Costs   Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.   Patent Costs   Legal costs incurred in connection with patent applications and costs of acquiring patents are capitalized when incurred.  When patents are granted, costs are amortized over a term representing the lesser of the life of the patent or the projected sales period of the product or process.   Revenue Recognition   Revenue is recognized using the following methods depending upon the terms of the contracts:  time and materials or fixed price.  Revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized at contractually agreed-upon rates based upon direct labor hours expended and other direct costs incurred.  Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized using unit-of-delivery methods.  Losses, if any, on contracts are recorded during the period when first determined.   Direct Contract and Operating Costs   The Company’s direct contract and operating costs consist primarily of labor and fringe costs for contact center personnel, subcontractors, telephone related costs, depreciation on computer hardware and software and related facilities costs.   Selling, General and Administrative Expense   The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management salaries and fringes, sales and marketing costs, finance and accounting, human resources, as well as general corporate costs and costs related to being a public company.   Income Taxes   Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end, based on enacted tax laws and   29      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'29\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\141162541688_D11854_2138720\\\\14680-1-co.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 21 16:25 2007\\'      statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  A valuation allowance is established based upon periodic assessments made by management to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.   Fair Value Information   The estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash, receivables, accounts payable, and bank line of credit reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, approximate their carrying value given their short maturities.   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model and has elected to use the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, has not restated results for prior periods.  At the time the Company adopted FAS 123R, there were no unvested options outstanding.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company realized $24,000 in stock based compensation expense relating to 59,000 stock options awarded in February 2006.  The effect of adopting FAS 123R increased the loss from operations, and decreased the income before taxes and the net income by $24,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, and had no effect on basic and diluted earnings per share, net cash flow from operations, or net cash flow from financing activities.   For the years prior to January 1, 2006, the Company elected the “disclosure only” presentation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” (FAS 123) and, consequently, did not record compensation expense relating to employee option grants provided the exercise prices were at or above fair value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.   On November 4, 2005, the Company had a total of 176,658 previously unvested stock options outstanding.  The exercise prices of all of these options were greater than the fair value of the Company’s stock.  On this day, the Board of Directors voted to fully vest all of the then outstanding stock options.  The average weighted exercise price of these options was $7.98.  The primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing the future compensation expense for these options upon adoption of “SFAS 123R.”  The related future stock-based employee compensation expense that was eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options is approximately $562,000, and had the effect of increasing the 2005 proforma loss from $3,110,977 to $3,672,738 and the proforma loss per share from $(0.26) to $(0.31).   To measure stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  The following table summarizes the pro-forma net loss and net loss per share resulting from applying SFAS 123.   The following table summarizes the pro-forma net loss and net loss per share resulting from applying FAS 123.                                         2005               2004                   Net loss, as   reported                               $       (2,848,748       )       $       (2,822,046       )                                                                               Add: stock-based   employee compensation expense included in reported net loss                               31,050               31,050                                                                                       (Deduct) add:   total stock-based employee compensation (expense) benefit determined under   fair-value based method for all awards                               (855,040       )       (605,051       )           Pro forma net   loss                               $       (3,672,738       )       $       (3,396,046       )                                                                               Net loss per   share — basic               As   reported               $       (0.24       )       $       (0.24       )                           Pro   forma               $       (0.31       )       $       (0.29       )                                                                               Net loss per   share — diluted               As   reported               $       (0.24       )       $       (0.24       )                           Pro   forma               $       (0.31       )       $       (0.29       )             30      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'30\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\141162541688_D11854_2138720\\\\14680-1-co.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 21 16:25 2007\\'                      Net income (Loss) Per Share   Basic net income (loss) per common share has been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding with an assumed increase in common shares outstanding for common stock equivalents.  At December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding 501,100 options, none of which were assumed likely to be exercised.  Diluted net loss per common share has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding without an assumed increase in common shares outstanding for common stock equivalents, as common stock equivalents are antidilutive.                         2006               2005               2004                   Weighted average   shares outstanding, basic               13,578,363               12,037,479               11,890,470                   Weighted average   dilutive common stock equivalents               —               —               —                   Weighted average shares   outstanding, diluted               13,578,363               12,037,479               11,890,470                     New Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN48”).  The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”  We are required to adopt FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007.   We are currently evaluating the impact this interpretation will have on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.   In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).  SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  We are required to adopt SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material affect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”).  SAB 108 addresses diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet.  The bulletin requires companies to quantify misstatements based on the impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.  We have adopted SAB 108 in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   2.             Restricted Investments   At December 31, 2005, the Company held $2,000,000 in a restricted certificate of deposit as collateral on the Company’s bank line of credit.  The Company was released from the bank line of credit restriction when the line of credit matured on March 31, 2006, (see Note 6 “Line of Credit”).  The certificate of deposit matured on June 30, 2006.  A restricted certificate of deposit is not required as collateral on the new line of credit.   3.             Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   Management regularly reviews the accounts receivables for uncollectible and potentially uncollectible accounts and when necessary establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts.

Intangible Assets   On March 1, 2004, the Company purchased certain assets of Daksoft, Inc. related to its reservation business, which operates under the name “ReserveIt.”  The purchase included the acquisition of six additional government reservation contracts and the intellectual property rights to the name “ReserveIt,” as well as other assets of the division.  Spherix purchased the assets for $700,000 plus the issuance of 43,029 shares of common stock valued at $288,000 (subject to certain restrictions).  The Company assessed the value of the purchased contracts to be $976,000 and will amortize it annually over seven years, the estimated contractual life.  In 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company recognized $139,000, $139,000, and $116,000, respectively, in related amortization expense.   The Company’s total amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $167,000, $161,000, and $140,000, respectively.  The Company’s future amortization over the next five years based on its intangible assets at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 are as follows:            SET mrlHTMLTableCenter  Year               Amortization    Expense                   2007               $       165,000                   2008               157,000                   2009               154,000                   2010               154,000                   2011               38,000                                     6.             Debt   Line of Credit   As a result of the creation of InfoSpherix as a wholly-owned subsidiary, management no longer considers maintaining a bank line of credit for the parent company, Spherix, necessary, and, therefore decided not to renew the old credit agreement when it matured on March 31, 2006.  The Company entered into a new agreement on March 31, 2006 with Bank of America (“the Bank”) to establish a line-of-credit (“New Agreement”) for its subsidiary, InfoSpherix Incorporated, with the outstanding borrowings of approximately $1.5 million under the old line of credit transferred to the new agreement.  Management considers the establishment of this credit facility for the subsidiary necessary to ensure timely cash flow for the subsidiary’s operations.  The New Agreement, which matures June 30, 2008, provides for borrowings up to $1.5 million, is collateralized by the subsidiary’s accounts receivables and equipment, and contains covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.  Such covenants could have a limiting effect on the amount of cash that the subsidiary can advance to Spherix.  The interest rate under the Agreement is based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.34% at December 31, 2006).  The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at December 31, 2006, and the total amount available for future advance to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under the Agreement.       32      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'32\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\141162541688_D11854_2138720\\\\14680-1-co.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 21 16:25 2007\\'        7.

Stockholder Equity   Private Placements   The Company determined that, as of June 30, 2005, it was approximately $454,000 short of meeting NASDAQ’s Global Market listing requirement of maintaining a minimum of $10,000,000 in shareholders’ equity.  NASDAQ gave the Company until September 1, 2005, to correct this situation, which the Company achieved through its third quarter results.  However, in anticipation of incurring losses due to seasonal fluctuations in the InfoSpherix business segment that occur in the first and fourth quarters of the year, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (“SEDA”) with Cornell Capital Partners, L.P. (“Cornell”) on July 22, 2005.  Under the SEDA, Spherix can require Cornell to purchase up to $4,000,000 of the Company’s common stock over a two-year period following the effective date, October 12, 2005, of the registration covering the shares of our common stock to be sold to Cornell.  The SEDA establishes what is sometimes termed an “equity line of credit” or an “equity draw-down facility.”  The $4,000,000 facility may be drawn down upon by us in installments, the maximum amount of each draw down is limited to $350,000.  For each share of common stock purchased under the SEDA, Cornell will pay 95% of the lowest volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s shares during the five trading days following the Company’s draw down notice to Cornell.  The VWAP used in the calculation is that reported by Bloomberg, LLC, a third-party reporting service.  In general, the VWAP represents the sum of the value of all the sales of our common stock for a given day (the total shares sold in each trade times the sales price per share of the common stock for that trade), divided by the total number of our shares sold on that day.  The Company is also committed to pay to Cornell an amount equal to 5% of each purchase of common stock made by Cornell under the SEDA.  Under the terms of the SEDA agreement, the Company is not obligated to draw down on the SEDA facility, but once we satisfy normal conditions for this type of transaction, we have the right to require Cornell to purchase our common stock.  In connection with the SEDA, we have issued to Cornell 95,000 shares of our common stock and paid a due diligence fee of $5,000.  We also paid Yorkville Advisors Management, LLC, the investment manager for Cornell, a structuring fee of $15,000, and on each sale under the SEDA we will pay an additional structuring fee of $500.  Newbridge Securities Corporation acted as our placement agent for the SEDA, and we paid that firm a fee of 5,000 shares of our common stock valued at $10,000.  We also granted Newbridge Securities Corporation piggy-back registration rights covering these shares.  Registration of our common shares covered under the SEDA was completed in October 2005.  During the term of the SEDA, our Officers and Directors have agreed not to sell any of their shares of our common stock, except to the extent permitted under Rule 144.  The number of shares of our common stock issuable to Cornell under the SEDA is subject to a 9.99% cap on the beneficial ownership that Cornell and its affiliates may have at the time of each installment (beneficial ownership is to be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).  Further, the Company may not issue more than 19.99% of our currently outstanding shares under the SEDA unless shareholder approval is received.  Fees paid through cash and common stock to Cornell, Yorkville Advisors, and Newbridge Security totaling $220,000 were charged against the proceeds of the initial draw on the facility.  In 2006, the Company sold 819,453 shares under the SEDA agreement for total proceeds of $1,897,000, and in 2005, the Company sold 310,076 shares under the SEDA agreement for total proceeds of $376,000.  At December 31, 2006, the Company’s shareholder’s equity was $14.6 million.   On March 9, 2006, in exchange for the Company’s agreement to reduce the exercise price of 585,973 in outstanding warrants to $2.04 per share, an Investor agreed to exercise the full 585,973 shares for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.  In connection with these warrants, the new holder of the warrants agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to the extent that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that their holdings in the   33      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'33\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137235315428_D11892_2133541\\\\14680-1-cq.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:53 2007\\'      Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock.  The warrants and shares of Common Stock were issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.  The Company has registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by the institutional investor.   Stock Option Plan   The Company has an Employees’ Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”) which permits issuance of both Incentive Stock Options (ISO) and Non-Qualified Stock Options, whereby options may be granted to officers and Directors and other key employees to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock in amounts determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors through December 31, 2007.  During 2006, 2005, and 2004, 59,000, 12,500, and 60,000 options were granted under the Plan, respectively.  At December 31, 2006, 403,100 options were available for grant under the Plan.   On November 4, 2005, the Company had a total of 176,658 previously unvested stock options outstanding.  The exercise prices of all of these options were greater than the fair value of the Company’s stock.  The Board of Directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all such outstanding stock options.  The average weighted exercise price of these options was $7.98.  The primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing the future compensation expense for these options upon adoption of “SFAS 123R.”  The estimated stock-based employee compensation expense that was eliminated as a result of this action was approximately $562,000, and had the effect of increasing the 2005 proforma loss from $3,110,977 to $3,672,738 and the proforma loss per share from $(0.24) to $(0.31).                         2006    Shares               2006    Weighted    Average    Exercise    Price               2005    Shares               2005    Weighted    Average    Exercise    Price               2004    Shares               2004    Weighted    Average    Exercise    Price                   Outstanding at   beginning of year               507,200               $       7.73               677,800               $       7.82               653,650               $       7.97                   Granted               59,000               $       2.20               12,500               $       3.41               60,000               $       5.98                   Exercised               —               $       —               —               $       —               —               $       —                   Expired or forfeited               (65,100       )       $       7.51               (183,100       )       $       7.79               (35,850       )       $       7.36                   Outstanding at end of   year               501,100               $       7.11               507,200               $       7.73               677,800               $       7.82                                                                                                                                       Options exercisable at   end of year               467,100                               507,200                               345,822                                   Weighted-average fair   value of options granted during the year                $        1.88                                $        1.92                                $        3.22                                                                                                                                                        Price range of options                                                                                                                   Outstanding               $       2.25-$10.51                               $       2.25-$10.51                               $       2.25-$10.51                                   Exercised               $       —                               $       —                               $       —                                   Expired or forfeited               $       4.99-$10.51                               $       6.35-$9.55                               $       6.00-$9.55                                     Activity for the three years ended December 31, 2006, for all option grants is shown below:                   The following table summarizes information with respect to stock options outstanding at December 31, 2006:                SET mrlHTMLTableCenter  Range of Exercise Price               Number of    Options    Outstanding    at 12/31/06               Weighted    Average    Exercise Price               Weighted    Average    Remaining    Contractual Life                   $2.25-$4.99               126,500               $       3.02               2.4                   $6.35-$7.84               83,850               $       6.73               1.0                   $8.09-$10.51               290,750               $       8.99               2.8                                   501,100                                                       34      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'34\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137235315428_D11892_2133541\\\\14680-1-cq.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:53 2007\\'      The following table summarizes information with respect to stock options exercisable at December 31, 2006:            SET mrlHTMLTableCenter  Year of Option    Expiration               Number of    Options               Weighted    Average    Exercise Price               Price Range                   2007               137,550               $6.28               $2.25-$10.51                   2008               192,050               $8.28               $6.35-$8.67                   2010               12,500               $3.41               $3.41                   2011               125,000               $7.91               $2.20-$9.34                                                                                       All Years               467,100                                                       The Company used the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes calculation used to measure the fair value of stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R.

The tax effect of significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, is as follows:                         2006               2005                                   Current               Non-Current               Current               Non-Current                   Property and equipment               $       —               $       (259,688       )       $       —               $       (762,137       )           Deferred rent               109,023               —               75,795               —                   Accrued vacation               68,547               —               70,218               —                   Allowance for doubtful   accounts               5,758               —               5,793               —                   Tax credit               —               90,000               —               —                   Deferred compensation               19,310               239,135               —               241,443                   Forward loss provision               25,911               —               52,137               —                   Net operating loss   carryforward               —               5,632,054               —               7,353,528                   Accrued bonus               —               —               32,055               —                   Other               (115       )       —               (10,728       )       —                                   228,434               5,701,501               225,270               6,832,834                   Valuation allowance               (228,434       )       (5,701,501       )       (225,270       )       (6,832,834       )                                                                                               Deferred tax asset               $       —               $       —               $       —               $       —                     Approximately $4.1 million in U.S. tax net operating losses were utilized in 2006.

Based on the Company’s historical losses and its accumulated deficit, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset.

Commitments and Contingencies   Government Contracts   The principal portion of the Company’s revenue has been generated under government contracts, by InfoSpherix.  These contracts are awarded pursuant to a competitive bidding process.  As of December 31, 2006, none of the Company’s contracts were under protest.  The Government has the right to audit billings and Spherix does not expect adjustments to such billings.   Leases   The Company has various commitments under capital and operating leases through 2011 relating to office equipment, its call center facility in Cumberland, Maryland, its call center facility in Carmel, Indiana, its call center and administrative offices in Beltsville, Maryland, and its research lab and administrative office in Annapolis, Maryland.

Levin, Company founder and former CEO, has served under an Employment Agreement since March 3, 1969.  This Agreement was amended and restated in 2004, and continued through December 31, 2004.  On February 17, 1993, the Company entered into agreements with Dr. Levin and Mrs. M. Karen Levin to provide adequate retirement benefits and to protect the Company’s stock from a precipitous sale to pay estate taxes upon their deaths.  These agreements provided that, upon retirement, under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), these individuals would receive deferred compensation equal to 70% and 60%, respectively, of their average annual total compensation less the assumed returns from investment of their funded pension plans, and less their social security payments.  On March 23, 2004, after lengthy consideration and consultation, the Board and the Levins approved new deferred compensation agreements.  At March 23, 2004, the deferred compensation plan for Dr. Levin was unfunded and the Company had no liability under the plan.  In the March 23, 2004 agreement, Dr. Levin voluntarily forgave the Company of its obligations under his SERP agreement.  The Company also has agreed to provide Dr. Levin with lifetime payments of $12,500 each quarter and to fund long-term lifetime healthcare and health insurance policies following his full retirement from the Company.  In 2004, Dr. and Mrs. Levin voluntarily forgave the Company its obligation to retain key man life insurance on them and to buy back stock from the last to survive.  On November 29, 2005, the Board and Mrs. Levin approved a new agreement concerning her retirement benefits in connection with her January 4, 2006 retirement from the Company.  At November 29, 2005, the deferred compensation plan for Mrs. Levin was unfunded and the Company had no liability under the plan as actuarially determined.  In the November 29, 2005 agreement, Mrs. Levin voluntarily forgave the Company its obligations under her SERP agreement.  The Company also has agreed to provide Mrs. Levin lifetime payments of $12,500 each quarter and to fund long-term lifetime healthcare and health insurance policies following her January 4, 2006, retirement from the Company.  At December 31, 2006, the Company’s liability for both Dr. Levin and Mrs. Levin was estimated to be $389,000 for the lifetime payments and $156,000 for funding the long-term lifetime healthcare and health insurance policies.  The non-current portion of these amounts is reported on the accompanying balance sheet as deferred compensation.   Upon completion of their employment, the officer-stockholders agree to serve as consultants to the Company on an as-needed basis, at a specified daily rate.   Other   In July 2005, Spherix filed an official protest of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s award of the National Recreation Reservation System (“NRRS”) contract to ReserveAmerica, a TicketMaster subsidiary.  The NRRS will provide reservation services for all Federal recreation facilities, including the National Park sites serviced by Spherix under its National Park Reservation Service (“NPRS”) contract with the Department of Interior.  On October 20, 2005, the Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) sustained Spherix’s challenge to the USDA Forest Service award and recommended that the Department of Agriculture reopen the competition and make a new award decision.  This was the second time that GAO found the Forest Service’s attempt to award the NRRS contract to ReserveAmerica to be flawed.  In October 2006, the Company agreed to a $6 million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the government’s award of the National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) contract to ReserveAmerica, a Ticketmaster subsidiary.  The Company’s NPRS contract concluded on January 23, 2007.  The Company operated the NPRS contract for nine years; revenue recognized was $4.0 million, $4.0 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, or 16%, 17% and 17% of total revenue for each year.   11.          Employee Benefit Plans   Effective January 1, 1990, the Company established the Spherix Incorporated 401(k) Retirement Plan.  The Plan is a discretionary defined contribution plan and covers substantially all employees who have attained the age of 21, have completed one year of service, and have worked a minimum of 1,000 hours in the past Plan or anniversary year.   Under provisions of the Plan, the Company, for any plan year, has contributed an amount equal to 50% of the participant’s contribution or 2½% of the participant’s eligible compensation, whichever is less.  The Company may, at   37      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'37\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\13723235326_D11556_2133308\\\\14680-1-cs.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:02 2007\\'      its own discretion, make additional matching contributions to participants.  Company contributions, net of forfeitures, amounted to $122,000, $113,000, and $105,000 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.   12.          Employee Stock Purchase Plan   On May 15, 2003, the Company approved an Employee Stock Purchase Plan whereby the employees could purchase shares of the Company’s stock.  Under the Plan, the Company was authorized to initially issue up to 500,000 shares of common stock, with additional amounts determined annually based upon other provisions of the Plan.  The Plan became available to the employees on January 1, 2004.  In 2005 and 2004, 6,985 and 1,796 shares were issued under the plan, respectively.  The Board of Directors voted to discontinue the plan effective June 30, 2005.   13.          Information by Business Segment   Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  The Company is managed along two business segments, InfoSpherix and BioSpherix.                   Financial information by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 is summarized below:                                         Year Ended December 31,                                                   (Dollars in thousands)                                                        2006                         2005                         2004                        Revenues               InfoSpherix               $       24,831               $       23,023               $       22,221                                   BioSpherix               7               23               127                                   Total revenues               $       24,838               $       23,046               $       22,348                                                                                                       Operating Loss and               InfoSpherix               $       723               $       (1,853       )       $       (2,051       )           Loss Before Income               BioSpherix               (3,203       )       (1,033       )       (794       )           Taxes               Total operating   loss               (2,480       )       (2,886       )       (2,845       )                           Interest income, net               98               37               23                                   Other income               6,000               —               —                                   Income (loss)   from operations before income taxes                $       3,618                $       (2,849        )        $       (2,822        )                                                                                                Identifiable Assets                    InfoSpherix               $       13,896               $       7,887               $       8,012                                   BioSpherix               308               288               196                                   General   corporate assets               4,172               4,943               7,036                                   Total assets               $       18,376               $       13,118               $       15,244                                                                                                       Capital               InfoSpherix               $       1,753               $       1,493               $       2,941                   Expenditures               BioSpherix               —               13               44                                   General   corporate assets               3               2               17                                   Total capital   expenditures               $       1,756               $       1,508               $       3,002                                                                                                       Depreciation               InfoSpherix               $       2,433               $       2,401               $       2,101                   and Amortization               BioSpherix               46               41               24                                   General   corporate assets               122               132               153                                   Total depreciation and   amortization               $       2,601               $       2,574               $       2,278                     During 2006, InfoSpherix recognized revenue from three of its customers, all of which were government agencies, representing 16%, 15% and 11% of the total Company revenue.

During 2004, InfoSpherix recognized revenue from three of its customers, all of which were government agencies, representing 21%, 17%, and 13% of the total Company revenue.  Government contracts accounted for approximately 99%, 100%, and 99% of the InfoSpherix revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.   BioSpherix has invented and patented for the Company the use of tagatose as a low-calorie sweetener.  In 1996, the Company signed an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Arla Foods Ingredients amba of Denmark (formerly MD Foods Ingredients) for the use and sale of Spherix’s low-calorie sugar, tagatose, as a sweetener in foods and beverages (see   Note 10 “Commitments and Contingencies”).  The License Agreement and an amendment thereto provide Arla the world-wide right to manufacture and sell tagatose for food uses, and the right to manufacture tagatose for all uses.  In 2000, MDFI was merged into Arla Foods.   Operating loss consists of revenue less operating expenses.  In computing operating profit, interest expense and income taxes were not considered.  Operating loss for InfoSpherix was 8% and 9% of InfoSpherix revenue for 2005 and 2004.   Identifiable assets by business segment are those assets used in the Company’s operations in each segment, such as accounts receivable, inventories, fixed assets, and patent costs.  Corporate assets are principally cash and certain other assets not related to a particular segment’s operations.   14.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE   None.   Item 9A.                   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rules adopted by the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.   Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.   Management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management’s override of the control.  The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.   Periodic Evaluation and Conclusion.    The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.  There were no significant changes in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   Compensation Discussion and Analysis   Objectives of Compensation Program and What Our Compensation Program is Designed to Reward   Our executive compensation program is designed to create strong financial incentive for our officers to increase revenue, profit, operating efficiency and returns, which we expect to lead to an increase in shareholder value.  The primary objective of our compensation program is to attract and retain qualified, energetic employees who are enthusiastic about the Company’s mission.  A further objective of our compensation program is to provide incentives and reward employees for their contribution to the Company.  In addition, we strive to promote an ownership mentality among key leadership and the Board of Directors.  Finally, we endeavor to ensure that our compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to all stakeholders.   The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) evaluates both performance and compensation to ensure that the Company maintains its ability to attract and retain superior employees in key positions and that compensation provided to key employees remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives of other companies.  To that end, the Committee believes executive compensation packages provided by the Company to its executives, including the named executive officers, should include both cash and stock-based components that reward performance as measured against established goals.   Our compensation program is designed to reward each employee’s contribution to the Company.  In measuring the named executive officers’ contribution to the Company, the Committee considers numerous factors including the Company’s growth and financial performance.   Throughout this Form 10-K, the individual who served as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer during 2006, as well as the other individuals included in the Summary Compensation Table on page 46, are referred to as the “named executive officers”.  Immediately following this Compensation Discussion and Analysis you will find a series of tables containing specific information about the compensation earned in 2006 by the named executive officers.   Roles and Responsibilities for Our Compensation Program   Role of the Compensation Committee   The Committee has responsibility for establishing, implementing and monitoring adherence with the Company’s compensation philosophy.   Role of our Chief Executive Officer   Our Chief Executive Officer provides recommendations to the Committee in its evaluation of our executive officers, including recommendations of individual cash and equity compensation levels for executive officers.  Mr. Levin relies on his personal experience serving in the capacity of Chief Executive Officer with respect to evaluating the contribution of our other executive officers as well as publicly available information for comparable compensation guidance as the basis for his recommendations to the Committee.  Mr. Levin was not present during Committee deliberations and voting pertaining to the determination of his own compensation.   44      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'44\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\138004595_D11892_2133571\\\\14680-1-cu.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 18 00:00 2007\\'          Role of the Compensation Consultant   The Committee periodically retains a consultant to provide independent advice on executive compensation matters and to perform specific project-related work.   Elements of Company’s Compensation Plan   The Company’s compensation program consists of base salary, an annual incentive bonus, stock incentives/awards, health and welfare benefits and a 401(k) plan.  The Company strives to be market competitive in setting salary ranges and designing benefits programs, while recognizing the experience and performance levels of individual employees.   Base Salary   The Company provides named executive officers and other employees with base salary to compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year.  Base salary is the fixed annual compensation we pay to an executive for performing specific job responsibilities.  It represents the minimum income an executive may receive in any given year.  Base salaries for named executive officers are determined for each executive based on position and responsibility.  Base salaries for each of the Company’s executives are determined by the executive’s responsibilities and performance as well as comparative compensation levels for the executive’s peers.  The base salary for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, including periodic changes thereto, is determined by the Committee.  The base salaries for the Company’s other executive officers, including periodic changes thereto, are determined by the Committee following recommendations by the Chief Executive Officer.   During its review of base salaries for executives, the Committee primarily considers:   ·                    market data;   ·                    internal review of the executive’s compensation, both individually and relative to other officers;   ·                    individual performance of the executive;  and   ·                    our financial and operating results.   Base salary levels are typically reviewed annually as part of the Company’s performance review process as well as upon a promotion or other change in job responsibility.   Annual Bonus    The Compensation Committee believes that a Pay-For-Performance Bonus system must be the process to provide additional compensation for all Spherix Executives and that this Bonus system must be based upon performance objectives developed from the Long Range Business Plan.  The President and Chief Executive Officer of Spherix, working with the Executive Staff,  set the performance bonus objectives.  The Board’s function was to review, to recommend modifications, and to approve the objectives and the financial bonuses associated with those objectives.   Stock Incentives/Awards   We currently administer long-term incentive compensation awards through our stock incentive plan.  We believe that widespread common share ownership by key employees is an important means of encouraging superior performance and employee retention.   In recent years, this component of the Company’s executive compensation program has been via the periodic grant of stock options.  The Company generally has issued stock options to its executive officers when they joined the Company, in connection with a significant promotion within the Company and/or as a reward following excellent performance.  The number of options granted has been based on the level of responsibility, Company performance and individual performance.  Stock option grants have also been structured to induce the executive to remain in the employment of the Company by including incremental vesting provisions which permit exercise only after satisfaction of minimum tenure requirements.  Options are forfeited upon termination.   45      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'45\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\138004595_D11892_2133571\\\\14680-1-cu.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 18 00:00 2007\\'          Health and Welfare Benefits   We offer a standard range of health and welfare benefits to all employees, including our executive officers.  These benefits include medical, prescription drug, and dental coverages, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and long-term disability insurance.  Our plans do not discriminate in favor of our executive officers.   401(k)   We offer a defined contribution 401(k) plan to substantially all of our employees.  We provide this plan to assist our employees in saving some amount of their cash compensation for retirement in a tax efficient manner.   Other Perquisites and Personal Benefits   We do not offer any perquisites or other personal benefits to any executive with a value over $10,000.   How Compensation Amounts Are Determined   We strive to pay our named executive officers at or near the median paid by comparable companies.  The Compensation Committee hired an outside company, Equilar, Inc., to compare the total compensation of the Spherix Executives to the total compensation of fourteen (14) companies identified by Equilar, Inc. to be peer companies to Spherix.  The Equilar Report on Executive Compensation showed that Spherix Executives are not compensated at the same level as colleagues in peer companies.  Based upon the fiscal health of Spherix however, it was determined by the Compensation Committee that no special efforts should be made to bring Executive total compensation to equivalent levels of those in peer companies.  All 2007 base salary increases (with few exceptions) should be kept in line with inflation. The Compensation Committee requested that the President and Chief Executive Officer of Spherix propose all Executive salary increases, but the overall Spherix company-wide increase should not be above inflation.  With minor adjustments, these recommendations were accepted by the full Board.  The Compensation Committee recommended to the Board the salary adjustment for the President and Chief Executive Officer of Spherix.   46      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'46\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\138004595_D11892_2133571\\\\14680-1-cu.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 18 00:00 2007\\'        The following summary of compensation table sets forth the compensation paid by the Company during the three years ended December 31, 2006, to all Executive Officers earning in excess of $100,000 during any year.

Cox, G.C. Creel, R.J. Vander Zanden, R.A. Lodder, J.T. Lowe, R.A. Downs, R.L. Clayton,  S.M. Wade, and All Executive Officers and Directors as a Group are 227,750, 60,000, 112,000, 7,500, 7,500, 7,500, 7,500, 5,000, 2,250, 2,000, 1,500, 500, and 436,000 shares, respectively, which such persons have a right to acquire within 60 days pursuant to stock options.   As of December 31, 2006, Dr. Levin, Chairman of the Board and Executive Officer for Science, and Mrs. Levin, Director and former Vice President, 3180 Harness Creek Road, Annapolis, Maryland, beneficially owned in the aggregate 2,728,457 shares of Common Stock (19.1% of the 14,287,804 outstanding shares 1 ). Dr. Levin and Mrs. Levin are husband and wife.  As principal Stockholders of the Company, they are considered control persons with respect to the Company.   All Directors and Executive Officers as a group, as beneficial owners of 2,934,932 shares of Common Stock, owned 20.5% of the 14,287,804 outstanding shares 1 . With the exception of Cede & Co., the holder of record for certain brokerage firms and banks, no other person is known by the Company to own beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company.   In February 2001, the Board of Directors adopted the Rights Agreement (the “Agreement”).  The Agreement provides each Stockholder of record a dividend distribution of one “right” for each outstanding share of the Company’s Common Stock.  Rights become exercisable at the earlier of ten days following:  (1) a public announcement that an acquirer has purchased or has the right to acquire 10% or more of the Company’s Common Stock, or (2) the commencement of a tender offer which would result in an offeror beneficially owning 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company.  All rights held by an acquirer or offeror expire on the announced acquisition date, and all rights expire at the close of business on December 31, 2010.  Each right entitles a Stockholder to acquire, at a stated purchase price, 1/100 of a share of the Company’s preferred stock, which carries voting and dividend rights similar to one share of its Common Stock.  Alternatively, a right holder may elect to purchase for the stated price an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a price per share equal to one-half of the average market price for a specified period.  In lieu of the stated purchase price, a right holder may elect to acquire one-half of the Common Stock available under the second option.  The purchase price of the preferred stock fractional amount is subject to adjustment for certain events as described in the Agreement.  At the discretion of a majority of the Board and within a specified time period, the Company may redeem all of the rights at a price of $0.001 per right.  The Board may also amend any provisions of the Agreement prior to exercise.   Item 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE   The current Board of Directors consists of Mr. Douglas T. Brown, Mr. A. Paul Cox, Jr., Mr. George C. Creel, Dr. Gilbert V. Levin, Mrs. M. Karen Levin, Mr. Richard C. Levin, Dr. Robert A. Lodder, Jr., and Dr. Robert J. Vander Zanden.  The Board of Directors has determined that a majority of its members, being Messrs. Brown, Cox, Creel, Lodder, and Vander Zanden, are independent Directors within the meaning of the applicable NASD rules.  The Company’s Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Committees consist solely of independent Directors.                                 (1)               Includes 475,600 shares which could be acquired pursuant to stock options or warrants within 60 days.   52      SEQ.=1,FOLIO=\\'52\\',FILE=\\'C:\\\\fc\\\\137235825937_D11892_2133563\\\\14680-1-cy.htm\\',USER=\\'jmsproofassembler\\',CD=\\'May 17 23:58 2007\\'          Item 14.
